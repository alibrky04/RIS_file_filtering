TI  - Investigating the Impact of ChatGPT as an AI Tool on ESL Writing : Prospects and Challenges in Saudi Arabian Higher Education
AU  - Abduljawad, SA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING
AB  - This research explores the impact of ChatGPT, an AI tool, on ESL students' writing proficiency at a Saudi Arabian university. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 130 students showed a significant positive effect on their writing. A focus group interview with six students highlighted opportunities such as personalized feedback, language skill development, vocabulary expansion, and greater autonomy. However, challenges included a lack of contextual understanding, loss of individuality in writing, reduced creativity, and ethical concerns. The findings offer valuable insights for educators on how to effectively integrate ChatGPT into writing instruction while addressing its challenges.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. This revolutionary technology holds immense potential in multiple domains, including the development of educational curricula. This article has explored the impact of AI on curriculum development in global higher education institutions, analyzing data from 2,000 faculty and student respondents, across five continents: North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, using a logistic regression model. The study found that frequent use of AI, the extent of the faculty knowledge, institution support to faculty, and the future expectation about AI are promoting curriculum development. Furthermore, the effectiveness of AI-driven tools in personalizing learning experiences, enhancing student engagement, identifying and addressing individual needs, providing real-time feedback, improving the quality of teaching and learning materials, and promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills is driving curriculum development. Moreover, the challenges limiting AI integration in curriculum development include its ability to personalize learning, adapt content based on student needs, ethical concerns, and hesitations in recommending AI use to other educational institutions. Besides, with respect to cultural and educational contexts in AI-powered tools, the integration of AI in global higher education curriculum development is hindered by its inability to align with and navigate the complexities of these contexts. In addition, educators' and leaders' perceptions and attitudes also influence AI's role in curriculum development. Factors such as AI's ability to create personalized learning experiences, familiarity with current AI tools, its effectiveness in identifying student learning gaps, willingness to undergo training and professional development, and its capacity to address biases in curriculum content stimulate development yet also present limitations. Importantly, our findings indicate that, while AI has enormous potential to revolutionize curriculum development, strategic approaches and policies are required to overcome the identified issues and improve AI integration in varied educational settings.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory research study was to examine the roles instructional designers (IDs) play in the integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into their higher education institutions, and how they use GenAI technologies in their own professional practices. Data were collected from 15 participants in the United States (U.S.) in an ID role or with similar job titles (e.g., educational technologist). Using a general qualitative approach, semi- structured interviews were conducted in Zoom about IDs' use and integration of GenAI. Our analysis resulted in three primary themes related to IDs' inte gration of GenAI in online and blended education: (a) the use of GenAI for instructional design; (b) collaborative guidance for faculty integration of GenAI; and (c) training, resources, and guidelines on the integration of GenAI. A common thread through a ll the themes was IDs' conscientious and cautious approach and ethical concerns about GenAI integration. We unpack these themes and discuss the implications of IDs in higher education integrating GenAI to meet organizational, faculty, and student needs.

T2  - INNOVATIVE HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The academic landscape is evolving with the integration of generative AI technologies, creating a new era in teaching and learning processes. This study investigates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within pedagogical strategies and policies at leading universities. It delves into how higher education institutions are amending and shaping policies regarding AI implementation, focusing on pedagogical, ethical, and privacy considerations. By thoroughly analyzing AI policies across 25 top-ranked universities, this study identifies the dominant approaches and challenges institutions face in utilizing AI. Our findings reveal diverse strategies ranging from embracing AI tools to enhance teaching efficiency and student engagement to addressing ethical concerns such as academic integrity and data privacy. However, in almost all universities, faculty can determine how these tools are used in their courses. This approach could encourage innovation and creativity in AI implementation. On the other hand, it could lead to inconsistency in students' learning experiences in different courses due to a lack of standardization. The results emphasize the necessity for a balanced approach to fostering innovation while safeguarding academic values and ethical standards, considering instructors' and learners' voices. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in education by providing insights into the dynamic interaction between AI technology and educational policy, proposing guidelines for institutions to navigate this evolving landscape effectively.

AU  - Alrayes, A
AU  - Henari, TF
AU  - Ahmed, DA
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - This paper provides a thorough examination of the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT and other AI language models, in the realm of education. Drawing insights from existing literature and a novel study on educator perspectives, the paper delves into the potential advantages, ethical dilemmas, and factors shaping educators' attitudes towards AI integration in education. AI language models have the potential to revolutionize educational content creation, personalize learning experiences, and streamline assessment and feedback processes. These capabilities hold the potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes while catering to the diverse needs of students. However, ethical concerns loom large in the adoption of AI in education. Bias in generated content is a chief concern, as it can perpetuate societal biases and lead to unfair treatment or the dissemination of inaccurate information. The solution lies in rigorous data curation to ensure equitable educational experiences for all students. Moreover, the potential for generating inappropriate or misleading content poses a significant ethical challenge, impacting students' well-being, civic understanding, and social interactions. Safeguards must be implemented to detect and rectify biased or inappropriate content, fostering inclusive and unbiased learning environments. Transparency emerges as a crucial ethical consideration. The opacity of AI models like ChatGPT makes it difficult to comprehend their decision-making processes. Enhancing model interpretability and explainability is vital for accountability and addressing embedded ethical issues. Privacy concerns related to data collection and usage are emphasized in the literature. Clear policies and guidelines must govern data collection, use, and protection, ensuring data is solely employed for educational purposes and maintaining robust data security measures. Our study expands upon these insights by exploring socio-demographic factors, motivations, and social influences affecting educators' AI adoption in higher education. These findings inform institutions on tailoring AI integration strategies, emphasizing responsible usage through training, and assessing the impact on learning outcomes. As educational institutions increasingly embrace AI, including advanced models like GPT-4, a cautious and thoughtful approach is vital. Balancing potential benefits with ethical challenges ensures that AI enhances teaching and learning while upholding fairness, equity, and accountability. In summary, this paper illuminates the potential of AI in education, accentuates ethical concerns, and highlights the significance of understanding educators' perspectives. Collaboration between educators and policymakers is essential to navigate the complexities of AI integration, ensuring that education remains a realm of equitable, efficient, and accountable learning experiences.

T2  - THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI), an educational innovation, has been adopted to facilitate diverse education contexts. While some educators utilized Al to empower entrepreneurship education, this digital strategy has not been explored comprehensively, especially from the perspective of higher education digital learners who use technology as their primary means of learning. To fill the gap, we conducted task-based interviews with 10 university digital learners after their participation of a digital learning and technology programme designed to foster creativity and entrepreneurship. In the interviews, students were invited to conduct SWOT analysis to examine the strengths and weaknesses of AI, along with its potential opportunities and threats in the context of entrepreneurship education. By collaboratively analysing the interview data with thematic analysis method, our study revealed the AI-empowered entrepreneurship education offers strengths like information support, personalized learning, and efficiency increase, but suffers from weaknesses like imprecise information, lack of interpersonal interaction, and technical limits. It provides opportunities like increased entrepreneurial chances, improved information access and fostering of entrepreneurship education 4.0. However, it may also pose threats like data security and privacy issues, over-reliance, ethical concerns, and educational inequality. We discuss the research findings, propose implications for educators to implement the digital strategy, and suggest future directions for entrepreneurship education practice and research to fully utilize AI in the subject.

TI  - The Role of AI-Assisted Learning in Academic Writing: A Mixed-Methods Study on Chinese as a Second Language Students
AU  - Chen, C
AU  - Gong, Y
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - This mixed-methods study examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted learning in academic writing for Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) students in a Chinese university context. Fifty international CSL students were randomly assigned to experimental-AI-assisted learning using ChatGPT-and control-traditional learning-groups. Writing samples from the participants were evaluated using established scoring rubrics for Chinese academic writing. Based on pre- and post-test quantitative data and supplementary qualitative interviews with six participants from the experimental group, this study reveals that AI-assisted learning can enhance student outcome by supporting knowledge acquisition, helping to create a supportive learning environment, and increasing student motivation. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding over-reliance on AI, particularly in relation to ethical concerns, technical and networking issues, and the unreliability of AI-generated content. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the impact of AI on CSL learners' academic writing performance. Finally, we also discuss practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the integration of AI into language education.

AB  - ChatGPT, at the forefront of artificial intelligence advancement, has caused excitement and scepticism within academic spheres due to its potential to affect academic processes. Understanding attitudes towards ChatGPT could help manage expectations and concerns for ChatGPT in academia, predict behaviour and inform policy. This studyaimed to develop an understanding of university academics' attitudes towards ChatGPT. A total of 11 university academics participated in semi-structured interviews. Data analysis found three main themes: (a) ethics, (b) changes to academic processes and (c) accessibility and inclusivity. Results showed academics had positive attitudes towards ChatGPT overall; however, they held negative attitudes towards the unethical use of the technology. Key findings included discrepancies in perceptions of academics' personal ethical use of ChatGPT compared to unethical use by others. Furthermore, academics viewed ChatGPT as a useful tool for saving time and enhancing research processes and student learning. Finally, ChatGPT could increase equity among diverse groups, though it should be used with caution. Future studies could conduct a longitudinal study and recruit a larger and wider sample exploring specific and/or multidisciplinary domains for research diversity and the generalisability of findings. Implications for practice or policy: center dot Academic policy and codes of conduct concerning the use of ChatGPT in research and education can be refined to address key ethical concerns, such as plagiarism. center dot Academic educators and researchers can save time and improve processes using ChatGPT to attain better work-life balance and thus potentially improve the quality of their work.

TI  - Higher Education's Generative Artificial Intelligence Paradox: The Meaning of Chatbot Mania
AU  - Rudolph, J
AU  - Ismail, MFB
AU  - Popenici, S
T2  - JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE
AB  - Higher education is currently under a significant transformation due to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, the hype surrounding GenAI and the increasing influence of educational technology business groups over tertiary education. This commentary, prepared for the Special Issue of the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice (JUTLP) on "Enhancing student engagement using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chatbots," delves into the complex landscape of opportunities and threats that AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, introduce to the realm of higher education. We argue that while GenAI offers promise in enhancing pedagogy, research, administration, and student support, concerns around academic integrity, labour displacement, embedded biases, environmental sustainability, increased commercialisation, and regulatory gaps necessitate a critical approach. Our commentary advocates for the development of critical AI literacy among educators and students, emphasising the necessity to foster an environment of responsible innovation and informed use of AI. We posit that the successful integration of AI in higher education must be grounded in the principles of ethics, equity, and the prioritisation of educational aims and human values. By offering a critical and nuanced exploration of these issues, our commentary aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how higher education institutions can navigate the rise of GenAI, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all stakeholders while upholding core academic values.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most prevalent topics in modern science. It is also reflected in the higher education sphere. Implementation of AI in university activities requires prior analysis of spheres where artificial intelligence can be used to provide responsible and smart use of AI. Based on the survey of educational process participants, the authors analysed the level of readiness of respondents to AI utilisation, their apprehension of AI's role in different spheres of university activities. The results of the survey have shown that most educational process participants either do not use artificial intelligence or use a very limited number of resources. Still the respondents estimated the possible impact of AI on different spheres of university activities as moderate or high. The spheres of open university ecosystem where AI can be used, were singled out and presented as a structural model. Among the spheres of university activities where AI can be implemented there are infrastructure, security, management and administration, research, ratings, sustainable development, learning personalisation, and e-learning. The selection of artificial intelligence tools for each sphere was performed and presented. Challenges of AI implementation are discussed, among which there are data security, privacy, ethical and legal issues, bias of AI, requirements to technical knowledge of university staff and university infrastructure, teachers' resistance, depersonalization of education, risks of education quality decrease. The advantages of AI implementation in each of the defined spheres are described. The need to document the rules of AI utilization at HEIs is stressed. The results of the research can be used for planning AI implementation in higher education institutions and AI policy formation.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - This perspective article focuses on the exploration and advocacy of approaches to be considered in designing equitable learning experiences for students' use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and technology through the Universal Design for Learning Framework (UDL) exemplifying chemistry examples that can be applied to any course in STEM. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are causing disruptions within learning in higher education and is also casting a spotlight on systemic inequities particularly affecting minoritized groups broadly and in STEM fields. Particularly, the emergence of AI has focused on inequities toward minoritized students in academic and professional ethics. As the U.S. education system grapples with a nuanced mix of acceptance and hesitation towards AI, the necessity for inclusive and equitable education, impactful learning practices, and innovative strategies has become more pronounced. Promoting equitable approaches for the use of artificial intelligence and technology in STEM learning will be an important milestone in addressing STEM disparities toward minoritized groups and equitable accessibility to evolving technology.

TI  - Can artificial intelligence help predict a learner's needs? Lessons from predicting student satisfaction
AU  - Parapadakis, D
T2  - LONDON REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB  - The successes of using artificial intelligence (AI) in analysing large-scale data at a low cost make it an attractive tool for analysing student data to discover models that can inform decision makers in education. This article looks at the case of decision making from models of student satisfaction, using research on ten years (2008-17) of National Student Survey (NSS) results in UK higher education institutions. It reviews the issues involved in measuring student satisfaction, shows that useful patterns exist in the data and presents issues involved in the value within the data when they are examined without deeper understanding, contrasting the outputs of analysing the data manually, and with AI. The article discusses risks of using AI and shows why, when applied in areas of education that are not clear, understood and widely agreed, AI not only carries risks to a point that can eliminate cost savings but, irrespective of legal requirement, it cannot provide algorithmic accountability.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Today, there is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both opportunities and challenges in higher education. This study examines three key areas: (1) students' use of ChatGPT, (2) their perceptions of its benefits and costs, and (3) the differences in attitudes toward AI integration in higher education between ChatGPT users and non-users. A sample of 737 undergraduate students at a Spanish university answered an online survey. The quantitative analysis revealed a high prevalence of ChatGPT use for academic and personal purposes, with students identifying its 24/7 accessibility as a major advantage, along with the time-saving benefits it offers. However, concerns were raised about potential costs, including the devaluation of university education when students rely on ChatGPT to complete assignments. Results indicate significant differences between ChatGPT users and non-users: users generally support AI integration in higher education, particularly in teaching methods, while non-users often oppose its integration, advocating for measures such as banning AI in universities. Our study provides valuable insights into student perspectives on the integration of ChatGPT in higher education, emphasizing the contrasting viewpoints of users and non-users. The findings underline the need for universities to actively involve students in shaping policies on artificial intelligence while offering targeted training to promote its responsible and ethical use. Furthermore, universities should support educators in adapting their teaching methodologies to the digital era by incorporating innovative strategies that enhance both teaching and learning.

TI  - What impacts matriculation decisions? Identifying students' university choice factors on a global scale with Artificial Intelligence
AU  - Cingillioglu, I
T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This study provides an empirical approach to utilizing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system for identifying students' university choice factors that impact their matriculation decision. We created an AI-based chatbot that gathered both qualitative and quantitative data from nearly 1200 participants worldwide. The entire human-AI interaction process was managed autonomously by the AI without researcher intervention. We analysed all data collected by the AI and identified relevant matriculation decision factors and themes. The AI collaboration demonstrated remarkable efficacy in streamlining the research workflow by consistently adhering to predefined criteria, eliminating variations and human-induced biases, establishing rapport with participants, and amplifying not just the efficiency and scalability of data collection but also the reliability and generalizability of the research findings. Acquiring such insights into students' university choice factors from such a diversified and large sample may potentially empower policymakers to make informed decisions that synch higher education policies with students' preferences, expectations, and needs, ultimately aiding institutions to improve recruitment and retention strategies leading to better overall performance and outcomes for both students and the institution itself. From an economic perspective, gaining this insight can foster closer alignment between higher education and the job market. By understanding students' aspirations and the influences driving their decisions, institutions can tailor programmes that not only enhance graduates' job prospects but also proactively contribute to economic growth and the development of a highly skilled and committed workforce.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies over traditional statistical methods for predicting student performance in e-learning contexts. Notably, many researchers have adopted AI techniques without conducting a comprehensive investigation into the most appropriate and accurate approach to employ. Additionally, determining the optimal input parameters for each AI technique remains a pertinent question in this domain. This study employs machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict student grades within a programming tutoring system. The experiment involved university students whose interaction data with the e-learning system were analyzed and used for predictions. By identifying the structural relationships between the properties of the input data, this research aims to determine the most efficient AI method for accurately predicting student performance in e-learning systems. The structure of the input data in these systems is described by variables related to individual student activities, so correlations between variables were a natural starting point for further theoretical considerations. In this manner, by applying a filtering technique based on the minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mrMR) criterion, it was shown that correlations among predictors and between predictors and the target variable play a significant role in defining the appropriate model for predicting student grades. The results showed that ANN (the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with Bayesian regularization) outperformed ML methods, achieving the highest prediction accuracy. The results obtained from this study can be of great importance for learning technologies engineering and AI in general.

TI  - Understanding AIgiarism in higher education: the lens of general AI attitudes and moral disengagement
AU  - Waqas, M
AU  - Hania, A
AU  - Chunyan, XU
T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The rapid integration of artificial intelligence in academic environments has created unprecedented challenges for maintaining academic integrity, particularly concerning AI-facilitated plagiarism (AIgiarism). Using stratified random sampling, we surveyed 373 undergraduate students across government universities in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate the complex interplay between institutional support mechanisms, moral-psychological processes, and students' engagement with AI tools in academic work. Through validated instruments, our research reveals a moderated mediation model where attitudes towards AI technology significantly mediate the relationship between academic support and AIgiarism (beta = -0.384, p < .001), with moral disengagement moderating both paths (beta = 0.152, p < .002; beta = 0.178, p < .001). These findings challenge traditional deterrence-based approaches to academic integrity and introduce the 'Mediated Digital Integrity Model,' emphasizing the dynamic interplay between institutional, attitudinal, and moral factors. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on digital academic integrity and provides crucial insights for developing integrated AI ethics programs in higher education.

AB  - In recent years, the advancement of generative artificial intelligence has had a significant impact on higher education, boosting its use for teaching and personalizing the learning experience. However, it also presents ethical and pedagogical challenges that must be addressed. Based on the above, it was decided to carry out a study that aims to explore the perceptions of university teachers about the integration and effectiveness of generative AI applications in higher education. A quantitative, transversal and descriptive methodology was used, with a survey structured on a Likert scale, it was applied to 105 higher education teachers from different universities in Mexico. The results reveal that, although teachers have a basic knowledge of generative AI, the deep understanding, integration and effective implementation of these technologies in educational processes is limited. Tools like ChatGPT are frequently mentioned, but their educational use remains low. Respondents expressed the need for adequate training and have concerns about plagiarism, reflecting a duality of opinions about the associated benefits and risks. It concludes on the importance of continuous training and critical understanding to maximize the benefits of IAG and mitigate its risks, ensuring that the knowledge transmitted is reliable and of high quality.

T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that nowadays has countless applications in many day-to-day and professional domains. Higher education institutions need to adapt both to changes in their processes and to changes in curricula brought on by AI. Studying students' attitudes toward AI can be useful for analyzing what changes in AI teaching need to be implemented. This article uses an electronic survey to study the attitudes of Spanish students in the fields of economics and business management and education. A learning experience was also implemented with a small subset of students as a hands-on introduction to AI, where students were prompted to reflect on their experiences as users of AI. The results show that students are aware of AI's impact and are willing to further their education in AI, although their current knowledge is limited due to a lack of training. We believe that AI education should be expanded and improved, especially by presenting realistic use cases and the real limitations of the technology, so that students are able to use AI confidently and responsibly in their professional future.

AB  - Different aspects of modern society can be transformed by the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI -powered tools have promoted changes in the financial industry by applying inventive methods for data analysis and automating processes, efficiency enhancement, cost reduction and more personalised services to customers. However, AI algorithms may activate significant ethical and regulatory concerns that should be addressed by the industry and society as a whole. In line with the Erasmus+ project Transversal Skills in Applied Artificial Intelligence - TSAAI (KA220-HED - Cooperation Partnerships in higher education), which aims to establish a training platform, this paper focuses on an analysis of study programmes in formal tertiary education across consortium countries (Spain, Estonia, North Macedonia, Croatia, Germany, and Slovenia) with a special focus on applied artificial intelligence and development of curriculum that will integrate teaching guidelines covering the areas of application of AI technology in the financial and insurance sectors. To this end, a Systematic Review of Literacy (SRL) on the web methodology identifying the existing employability requirements in AI and the Learning -Centred Syllabus (LCS) methodology for curriculum development was applied, with the presented curriculum expected to serve as a framework to develop teaching materials to help students, academics and employees enhance their professional skills, thus satisfying labour market needs.

T2  - ONLINE LEARNING
AB  - Since the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in late 2022, many scholars and thought leaders have wondered about its impact on higher education. This study used a survey methodology (three multiple choice questions and one open-ended question) to explore the perspectives of a nationally representative sample of 1,327 U.S. administrators and faculty, asking questions to understand how much change they anticipate as a result of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, how prepared their institution is for such change, and what aspects of higher education they expect to change. The researchers used Kranzberg's Laws of Technology as a lens to interpret the findings and guide the subsequent discussion about how AI might impact higher education. The findings showed that the vast majority of participants expect that AI will change their institution over the next five years and that the majority of participants do not feel that their institution is ready for change. The comments left in response to the openended questions fell into one of four themes: concerns about academic integrity and rigor, issues related to AI integration (e.g., anticipated benefits, practices in teaching and learning, issues related to preparedness, and the expected scope of change), the feeling that the current AI discourse is merely hype, and feelings of uncertainty. Ultimately, AI has the potential to be both advantageous and disadvantageous to teaching and learning, with the benefits and challenges of its use varying by context.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING
AB  - Given the very recent appearance and rapid dissemination of tools based on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the ChatGPT application, and the inevitability of their installation in the lives of students and professors, this article proposes the creation of a new "transversal skills" curricular unit to be taught to students in the Engineering Programs at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. Given the "revolution" that these AI-based tools can represent, it is important to reflect on what they constitute, how they can support professors in their teaching tasks, how they can support students in acquiring and interrelating knowledge and developing their competences, and how they can shape assessment processes. This article begins by analyzing the characteristics, potential and limitations of AI and the importance of developing AI-related transversal skills in higher education, followed by examples of the application of AI-based tools in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. Finally, the design of an AI-based curricular unit is proposed, as well as a methodology for identifying, assessing and mitigating the effects of biases in AI applications in curricula. Despite this proposal is directly applicable to STEM courses, it can be easily adapted to other areas of study.

TI  - Integrating Generative AI in University Teaching and Learning: A Model for Balanced Guidelines
AU  - Cacho, RM
T2  - ONLINE LEARNING
AB  - The study proposes a balanced approach and flexible guidelines for incorporating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into university-level teaching and learning processes at both the university-departmental level and within individual academic autonomy. Building on the AI Ecological Education Policy Framework, the guidelines offer a suggestive frame of reference for faculty and students to integrate generative AI into their coursework. Furthermore, feedback from 118 students and 14 academics at a teacher education institution in the Philippines underscores the guidelines' potential benefits, concerns, usefulness, and necessity in their academic undertakings. While the policy may not cover every detail exhaustively, it seeks to provide practical and context-sensitive recommendations for ethical, honest, responsible, and fair use of AI in course development, implementation, and student engagement. Consequently, other higher education institutions in general, and academics in particular, may adopt and/or modify the guidelines to suit their positions, goals, needs, and directions.

AB  - Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has permeated various aspects of daily life, including education, specifically within higher education settings. These AI technologies have transformed pedagogy and learning, enabling a more personalized approach. However, ethical and practical concerns have also emerged, including the potential decline in cognitive skills and student motivation due to excessive reliance on AI.Objective To develop and validate a Scale for Dependence on Artificial Intelligence (DIA).Methods An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to identify the underlying structure of the DIA scale, followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess and confirm this structure. In addition, the scale's invariance based on participants' gender was evaluated.Results A total of 528 university students aged between 18 and 37 years (M = 20.31, SD = 3.8) participated. The EFA revealed a unifactorial structure for the scale, which was subsequently confirmed by the CFA. Invariance analyses showed that the scale is applicable and consistent for both men and women.Conclusion The DAI scale emerges as a robust and reliable tool for measuring university students' dependence on AI. Its gender invariance makes it applicable in diverse population studies. In the age of digitalization, it is essential to understand the dynamics between humans and AI to navigate wisely and ensure a beneficial coexistence.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Mental well-being holds paramount importance and its relevance within the realm of higher education is undeniable. The academic journey often brings about unique challenges, stressors, and transitions that can impact students' mental health (MH). This study explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and MH education within higher education institutions, focusing on the intersection between Deep Learning (DL), MH education, and policy. The research aims to assess how AI can enhance MH support systems in educational settings and whether a combination of DL and MH education can contribute to a psychologically healthy community. The study tests hypotheses regarding the fundamental need for MH education to cope with stress, the role of AI in diagnosing mental health issues, the potential for AI to predict and reduce anxiety and depression, and the impact of policies in making MH education a mandatory component. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 600 valid responses from students, faculty members, educational technologists, and MH professionals across 12 universities in China. The data were analyzed using SPSS, revealing strong support for the integration of AI and MH education in promoting a psychologically healthy academic environment. The novelty of this study lies in its innovative integration of DL, MH education, and policy, offering a unique model for supporting mental health in higher education. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of how technology, education, and policy can collectively enhance student well-being and inform future strategies for integrating AI into educational and mental health practices.

TI  - Shifting Dynamics: Who Holds the Reins in Decision-Making With Artificial Intelligence Tools? Perspectives of Gen Z Pre-Service Teachers
AU  - Merzifonluoglu, A
AU  - Gunes, H
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly shaping education and currently influencing pre-service teachers' academic and professional journeys. To explore this influence, the present study examines 389 Generation Z pre-service teachers' attitudes towards AI and its impact on educational decision-making at two state universities, using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods research design. Quantitative data were collected through the General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) and an AI decision-making survey. It was followed by qualitative data gathered via semi-structured interviews to enrich the statistical trends with deeper thematic insights. SPSS was used for quantitative data analysis while MAXQDA was employed for a systematic analysis of the qualitative data. The analysis revealed that female pre-service teachers held more positive attitudes towards AI, with higher levels of AI knowledge contributing to these attitudes. Negative attitudes, however, were independent of gender, academic discipline or AI familiarity. Findings also reveal that AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, are primarily used as advisors, and pre-service teachers often adapt AI's suggestions to their preferences. AI is predominantly preferred for assignments, reports, projects and presentations. In AI acceptance, time and effort savings, innovative suggestions and unbiased recommendations are stated as key factors. However, there are ongoing trust concerns highlighting the necessity of keeping final decisions under human control. Based on these findings, comprehensive AI training for teachers and students in higher education is suggested.

TI  - AI, Biometric Analysis, and Emerging Cheating Detection Systems: The Engineering of Academic Integrity?
AU  - Oravec, JA
T2  - EDUCATION POLICY ANALYSIS ARCHIVES
AB  - Cheating behaviors have been construed as a continuing and somewhat vexing issue for academic institutions as they increasingly conduct educational processes online and impose metrics on instructional evaluation. Research, development, and implementation initiatives on cheating detection have gained new dimensions in the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) applications; they have also engendered special challenges in terms of their social, ethical, and cultural implications. An assortment of commercial cheating-detection systems have been injected into educational contexts with little input on the part of relevant stakeholders. This paper expands several specific cases of how systems for the detection of cheating have recently been implemented in higher education institutions in the US and UK. It investigates how such vehicles as wearable technologies, eye scanning, and keystroke capturing are being used to collect the data used for anti-cheating initiatives, often involving systems that have not gone through rigorous testing and evaluation for their validity and potential educational impacts. The paper discusses accountability- and policy-related issues concerning the outsourcing of cheating detection in institutional settings in the light of these emerging technological practices as well as student resistance against the systems involved. The cheating-detection practices can place students in a disempowered, asymmetrical position that is often at substantial variance with their cultural backgrounds.

T2  - JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
AB  - PurposeThis purpose of this paper is to report on the development of an evidence-informed framework created to facilitate the formulation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) academic integrity policy responses for English medium instruction (EMI) higher education, responding to both the bespoke challenges for the sector and longstanding calls to define and disseminate quality implementation good practice.Design/methodology/approachA virtual nominal group technique engaged experts (n = 14) in idea generation, refinement and consensus building across asynchronous and synchronous stages. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively.FindingsThe GenAI Academic Integrity Policy Development Blueprint for EMI Tertiary Education is not a definitive mandate but represents a roadmap of inquiry for reflective deliberation as institutions chart their own courses in this complex terrain.Research limitations/implicationsIf repeated with varying expert panellists, findings may vary to a certain extent; thus, further research with a wider range of stakeholders may be necessary for additional validation.Practical implicationsWhile grounded within the theoretical underpinnings of the field, the tool holds practical utility for stakeholders to develop bespoke policies and critically re-examine existing frameworks.Social implicationsAs texts produced by students using English as an additional language are at risk of being wrongly accused of GenAI-assisted plagiarism, owing to the limited efficacy of text classifiers such as Turnitin, the policy recommendations encapsulated in the blueprint aim to reduce potential bias and unfair treatment of students.Originality/valueThe novel blueprint represents a step towards bridging concerning gaps in policy responses worldwide and aims to spark discussion and further much-needed scholarly exploration to this end.

T2  - INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The use of generative AI is controversial in education largely because of its potential impact on academic integrity. Yet some scholars have suggested it could be particularly beneficial for students with disabilities. To date there has been no empirical research to discover how these students use generative AI in academic writing. Informed by a prior interview study and AI-literacy model, we surveyed students regarding their use of generative AI, and gained 124 valid responses from students with disabilities. We identified primary conditions affecting writing such as ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autism. The main generative AI used were chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, and rewriting applications. They were used in a wide range of academic writing tasks. Key concerns students with disabilities had included the inaccuracy of AI answers, risks to academic integrity, and subscription cost barriers. Students expressed a strong desire to participate in AI policymaking and for universities to provide generative AI training. The paper concludes with recommendations to address educational disparities and foster inclusivity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT with their human-like intelligence and language processing capabilities are significantly impacting the way we live, work, and communicate with each other. While scholars have increasingly focused on the use of GenAI in higher education since its inception, little is known about how key higher education stakeholders, particularly students, perceive its impact on teaching and learning within the context of academic communication, an area central to students' development of transferable skills and literacy competencies yet heavily influenced by the technology. This empirical study addresses the gap by investigating students' experiences and attitudes toward GenAI tools for English academic communication, focusing on their overall perceptions, perceived benefits, limitations, and challenges. Drawing on data from a questionnaire survey with 475 students and interviews with 12 at two universities in China, our findings indicate that students generally view GenAI positively, considering them useful for learning academic communication skills, particularly in writing, grammar, vocabulary, and reading. However, limitations are recognized in terms of giving feedback on critical thinking, creativity, and speaking skills. In addition, information reliability, ethical issues, and impact on assessment and academic integrity also emerged as important concerns. Our study argues that universities should embrace and capitalize on the affordances of GenAI and address its challenges to better support students' learning of critical academic literacy.

AB  - The popularity of ChatGPT raises concerns about the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on higher education. While past research explored how ChatGPT, a widely recognized text-based generative AI, can improve productivity and efficiency in education, little is yet known about its impact on course design. Utilizing Bloom's taxonomy and Biggs' constructive alignment, this research examined the potential influence of ChatGPT on course design. We conducted 19 interviews with lecturers from seven universities located in different countries, who teach a range of business school courses with course objectives at various Bloom's levels. Additionally, we interviewed three educational specialists with expertise in educational technology and pedagogy. Respondents had mixed opinions about ChatGPT's influence on learning and course design. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of ChatGPT may be influenced by the complexity of learning outcomes as defined by Bloom's taxonomy. The researchers propose a framework that teachers can use to mitigate its negative impacts.

AB  - Generative AI has prompted educators to reevaluate traditional teaching and assessment methods. This study examines AI's ability to write essays analysing Old English poetry; human markers assessed and attempted to distinguish them from authentic analyses of poetry by first-year undergraduate students in English at the University of Oxford. Using the standard UK University grading system, AI-written essays averaged a score of 60.46, whilst human essays achieved 63.57, a margin of difference not statistically significant (p = 0.10). Notably, student submissions applied a nuanced understanding of cultural context and secondary criticism to their close reading, while AI essays often described rather than analysed, lacking depth in the evaluation of poetic features, and sometimes failing to properly recognise key aspects of passages. Distinguishing features of human essays included detailed and sustained analysis of poetic style, as well as spelling errors and lack of structural cohesion. AI essays, on the other hand, exhibited a more formal structure and tone but sometimes fell short in incisive critique of poetic form and effect. Human markers correctly identified the origin of essays 79.41% of the time. Additionally, we compare three purported AI detectors, finding that the best, 'Quillbot', correctly identified the origin of essays 95.59% of the time. However, given the high threshold for academic misconduct, conclusively determining origin remains challenging. The research also highlights the potential benefits of generative AI's ability to advise on structuring essays and suggesting avenues for research. We advocate for transparency regarding AI's capabilities and limitations, and this study underscores the importance of human critical engagement in teaching and learning in Higher Education. As AI's proficiency grows, educators must reevaluate what authentic assessment is, and consider implementing dynamic, holistic methods to ensure academic integrity.

AU  - Song, H
T2  - MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION REVIEW
AB  - Amidst the persistent and increasingly visible discrimination and injustice against racially minoritized groups during and after the global COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian higher education has stressed the incorporation of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) into curricular planning and practice. In parallel to the EDI emphasis at the institutional level, of importance is an urgent understanding of the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically relating to its impact and possibilities for meaningful academic engagement and advancement of critical scholarship in academia. In light of this, the paper discusses the pedagogical challenges and possibilities of creating EDI-foregrounded English for academic purposes (EAP) teaching in this evolving context of AI. Drawing on the concepts of 'super-diversity' and transnational belonging as characteristics of global citizens , as well as transformative multiliteracies pedagogy, the article introduces multimodal and multiliteracies-engaging instructional design to EAP teaching navigated through action research and demonstrates how the newly developed instructional design has corresponded to the reality of EDI and the emergence of AI in Canadian higher education. This study underscores the necessity for a more nuanced understanding of EDI within the localized context of EAP teaching situated in a large cosmopolitan city in Canada.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies are gaining traction in higher education, offering potential benefits such as personalized learning support and enhanced productivity. However, successful integration requires understanding the factors influencing students' adoption of these emerging tools. This study investigates the determinants shaping higher education students' adoption of GAI through the lens of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 framework. Data was collected from Pyatigorsk State University students and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal habit (HB) as the most influential predictor of GAI adoption among students, followed by performance expectancy. Hedonic motivation, social influence (SI), and price value positively influenced behavioral intention (BI) to use these technologies. Surprisingly, facilitating conditions (FCs) exhibited a negative effect on BI, suggesting potential gaps in support systems. The study identifies no significant gender differences in the underlying factors driving adoption. Based on the results, recommendations are provided to foster HB formation, communicate benefits, enhance hedonic appeal, leverage SI, address price concerns, and strengthen FCs. Potential limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, geographic constraints, reliance on self-reported measures, and the lack of consideration for individual differences as moderators. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on GAI adoption in educational contexts, offering insights to guide higher education institutions in responsibly integrating these innovative tools while addressing student needs and promoting improved learning outcomes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - PurposeThis study contributes to the current body of literature on students' understanding of academic misconduct, plagiarism, forms of plagiarism, the reasons they plagiarize, the sanctions imposed by academics for plagiarizing and the methods to address plagiarism in written assessments within the Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Guyana, which was investigated in 2021.Design/methodology/approachThe research design was descriptive and grounded in the pragmatism paradigm. The methodology employed was quantitative, consisting of the collection of data through an online, self-administered questionnaire-based survey.FindingsThe results showed that despite students having a conceptual understanding of academic misconduct and plagiarism, they intentionally and unintentionally plagiarized their written assessments, mainly because of the assessment workload (64.9%), busy schedule (52.8%), not understanding the assessment (46.3%) and not knowing how to correctly cite sources (44.6%). Prevalent forms of plagiarism committed by students included finding synonyms for the author's language while keeping to the same general structure and meaning of the original work (48%) and neglecting to cite sources, misquote sources or unintentionally paraphrase a source by using similar words, groups of words and/or sentence structure without attribution (42%). Academic sanctions commonly include giving an overall reduced grade, giving a warning and asking the student to redo the plagiarized work. The study showed that students preferred flexible and lenient penalties to address plagiarism and objected to sanctions that may jeopardize their academic progression.Originality/valueAn international literature review will demonstrate extensive research on academic misconduct, particularly plagiarism, emphasizing attitudes and perceptions. Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and limited software subscriptions, academic misconduct in Guyana is still poorly understood. Therefore, this study adds to the literature by evaluating tertiary education students' perceptions of plagiarism, given the growing concerns and negative repercussions of plagiarism and student use of AI to produce assignments at this university.

AU  - Neittaanmäki, N
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Background The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), and especially generative AI, is transforming many medical fields, while medical education faces new challenges in integrating AI into the curriculum and is facing challenges with the rise of generative AI chatbots.Objective This survey study aimed to assess medical students' attitudes toward AI in medicine in general, effects of AI in students' career plans, and students' use of generative AI in medical studies.Methods An anonymous and voluntary online survey was designed using SurveyMonkey and was sent out to medical students at Gothenburg University. It consisted of 25 questions divided into various sections aiming to evaluate the students' prior knowledge of AI, their use of generative AI during medical studies, their attitude toward AI in medicine in general, and the effect of AI on their career plans.Results Of the 172 students who completed the survey, 74% were aware of AI in medicine, and 71% agreed or strongly agreed that AI will improve medicine. One-third were frightened of the increased use of AI in medicine. Radiologists and pathologists were perceived as most likely to be replaced by AI. Interestingly, 37% of the responders agreed or strongly agreed that they will exclude some field of medicine because of AI. More than half argued that AI should be part of medical training. Almost all responders (99%) were aware of generative AI chatbots, and 64% had taken advantage of these in their medical studies. Fifty-eight percent agreed or strongly agreed that the use of AI is supporting their learning as medical students.Conclusion Medical students show high expectations for AI's impact on medicine, yet they express concerns about their future careers. Over a third would avoid fields threatened by AI. These findings underscore the need to educate students, particularly in radiology and pathology, about optimizing human-AI collaboration rather than viewing it as a threat. There is an obvious need to integrate AI into the medical curriculum. Furthermore, the medical students rely on AI chatbots in their studies, which should be taken into consideration while restructuring medical education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundAs artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly advances, it becomes imperative to equip students with tools to navigate through the many intricate ethical considerations surrounding its development and use. Despite growing recognition of this necessity, the integration of AI ethics into higher education curricula remains limited. This paucity highlights an urgent need for comprehensive ethics education initiatives in AI, particularly for science and engineering students who are at the forefront of these innovations. Hence, this research investigates the role of an online explicit-reflective learning module in fostering science and engineering graduate students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and problem-solving skills. The study's participants included 90 graduate students specializing in diverse science and engineering research tracks. Employing the embedded mixed-methods approach, data were collected from pre- and post-intervention questionnaires with closed-ended and open-ended questions.ResultsThe study's results indicate that the online explicit-reflective learning module significantly enhanced students' knowledge of AI ethics. Initially, students exhibited a medium-high level of perceived ethical awareness, which saw a modest but statistically significant enhancement following the participation. Notably, a more distinct increase was observed in students' actual awareness of ethical issues in AI, before and after the intervention. Content analysis of students' responses to the open-ended questions revealed an increase in their ability to identify and articulate concerns relating to privacy breaches, the utilization of flawed datasets, and issues of biased social representation. Moreover, while students initially displayed limited problem-solving abilities in AI ethics, a considerable enhancement in these competencies was evident post-intervention.ConclusionsThe study results highlight the important role of explicit-reflective learning in preparing future professionals in science and engineering with the skills necessary for ethical decision-making. The study highlights the need for placing more emphasis not only on students' ability to identify AI-related ethical issues but also on their capacity to resolve and perhaps mitigate the impact of such ethical dilemmas.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants have become an essential part of our daily lives. Yet, little is known concerning what motivates students to use them in educational activities. Therefore, this research develops a theoretical model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with subjective norm, enjoyment, facilitating conditions, trust, and security to examine students' use of AI-based voice assistants for instructional purposes. The developed model was then validated based on data collected from 300 university students using the PLS-SEM technique. The results supported the role of enjoyment, trust, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in affecting the perceived usefulness (PU) of voice assistants. The empirical results also showed that facilitating conditions and trust in technology strongly influence the PEOU. Contrary to the extant literature, the results indicated that subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and security did not impact PU. Similarly, subjective norm and enjoyment did not affect PEOU. This research is believed to add a holistic understanding of the key drivers affecting students' use of voice assistants for educational purposes. It offers several theoretical contributions and practical implications on how to successfully employ these assistants.

TI  - Evaluating UK academics' perspectives of ethics education within computer science degree programmes: a preliminary insight
AU  - O'Shea, K
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS EDUCATION
AB  - Emerging systems using artificial intelligence (AI) including the complexities of deep learning leading to decision-making outcomes pose challenge, risk alongside opportunities to revolutionize business sectors and thus, human life. Building AI that impact on critical decision-making must be entwined with ethical questioning from the initial conception of design. As academics educating future technologists, we must lead on embedding the importance of ethical thinking for equitable designed systems. Currently, it is unclear across UK Higher Education how widely ethics is taught across programmes of study within computer science disciplines, their importance within the curriculum plus the confidence of academics for its delivery. This paper carries out a survey analysis to identify gaps, measures of engagement, expertise and knowledgebase of topics through both quantitative and qualitative questioning. The survey was distributed to 15 member universities of the Council for Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC) randomly selected across the UK for which 32 academics engaged in the study. Results show ethics was noted as being important although one-third reported it was not widely embedded across the curriculum. Just less than half of participants schedule the teaching of ethics regularly either across one or several modules. Interestingly, 91% of respondents stated that they have not received any instruction or training and that 62% felt that they require more training on the subject matter. This paper is inspired by wider research from European studies however, this study provides a specific novel focus on a broad range of UK universities, providing comparative analysis and unique findings from the UK perspective. The significance of these findings suggest academics perspectives vary with specific training needs. This demonstrates that this early-stage research requires further exploration of the wider computer science curriculum, sharing of good practice and collaborative working.

AB  - The prediction of university dropout is a complex problem, given the number and diversity of variables involved. Therefore, different strategies are applied to understand this educational phenomenon, although the most outstanding derive from the joint application of statistical approaches and computational techniques based on machine learning. Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is a challenging problem that can be addressed following various strategies. On the one hand, machine learning approaches formulate it as a classification task whose objective is to compute the probability of belonging to a class based on a specific feature vector that will help us to predict who will drop out. Alternatively, survival analysis techniques are applied in a time-varying context to predict when abandonment will occur. This work considered analytical mechanisms for supporting the decision-making process on higher education dropout. We evaluated different computational methods from both approaches for predicting who and when the dropout occurs and sought those with the most-consistent results. Moreover, our research employed a longitudinal dataset including demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information from six academic departments of a Latin American university over thirteen years. Finally, this study carried out an in-depth analysis, discusses how such variables influence estimating the level of risk of dropping out, and questions whether it occurs at the same magnitude or not according to the academic department, gender, socioeconomic group, and other variables.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated alternative pedagogical approaches, with online autonomous learning courses emerging as a viable method for compiling learning portfolios. Consequently, online autonomous learning has garnered increasing scholarly attention. Embodying principles of openness and transcending temporal and spatial constraints, online courses afforded global learners opportunities for continued education during the pandemic. Online courses facilitate enhanced online interaction among students and teachers and allow students to control their learning experience (learner autonomy) and pace. Nevertheless, online autonomous learning presents fundamental challenges. Notably, in the absence of direct teacher and teaching assistant supervision, online autonomous learning tends to lead to lower completion rates and higher dropout rates, concerns currently under investigation by numerous researchers. In contrast to traditional teacher-centered models, online autonomous learning courses prioritize self-directed learning. Learners independently establish learning objectives and strategies commensurate with their personal learning levels to master course content. Through a series of instructional videos, in-class exercises, discussion forums, and other interactive features, an appropriate self-regulated learning mechanism was developed to guide learners toward effective autonomous learning. The exponential growth of big data in recent years has positioned artificial intelligence as focal point of inquiry across various fields. Machine learning has catalyzed substantial advancements in the field of data science. The accumulation of extensive learning generates substantial volumes of structured and unstructured data, including the personal information of learners and various learning metrics. A growing body of research advocates for the use of data analytics as a viable method to optimize online and adaptive learning processes. Learning diagnosis entail learners' self-assessment of requisite capabilities for learning tasks and comparative analyses of capabilities against domain expert-established concept structures by employing relevant question parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination. To facilitate this, an automated artificial intelligence material recommendation mechanism was developed, underpinned by several machine learning models. By observing online user learning behavior patterns, learning data and indicators were formulated, enabling the analysis of various online learning behaviors (e.g., watching videos and answering practice questions) and the generation of learning processes that can be viewed by learners. A practice question recommendation mechanism combined with an instant messaging application (LINE) was designed, leveraging teacher-created knowledge maps to assess students' mastery of concepts. Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation served as the foundational framework for the recommendation mechanism. A quasiexperimental research design was employed. Participants were recruited from a calculus course taught at a university in northern Taiwan. An experimental group used reinforcement learning - recommended practice questions for self-evaluation, and a control group received randomly assigned questions. Significant improvements in scores were observed in the experimental group, and greater learning stickiness was observed compared with the control group. Consistent percentile rank increases following practice question completion suggest the system's capacity to deliver personalized recommendations on the basis of individual differences, thereby facilitating concept-specific feedback and adaptive learning. This, in turn, fostered increased teacher-student interaction, mitigated learner isolation, and increased learning motivation, thereby strengthening self-regulated learning abilities. Upon course completion, the participants could autonomously generate artificial intelligence learning portfolios through the system on the basis of diagnostic results, creating a comprehensive record of their learning performance. These portfolios facilitated the elucidation of learner mastery levels through the accumulation of extensive learning data (big data) on the platform. A postcourse self-regulated learning questionnaire survey revealed a positive participant perception of the materialrecommendation mechanism and generated artificial intelligence learning portfolio. The participants demonstrated strong positive attitudes toward system reliability, learning attitudes, and metacognition but low perceptions of system utility, and low overall usage rates. Enhancing usage incentive, continuously refining the accuracy of the recommendation system's algorithms, and conducting comparative analyses with existing systems are essential to improve the recommendation system's perceived utility.

T2  - ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - PurposeIn recent years, studies have shown that machine learning significantly improves student performance and retention and reduces the risk of student dropout and withdrawal. However, there is a lack of empirical research reviews focusing on the application of machine learning to predict student performance in terms of learning engagement and self-efficacy and exploring their relationships. Hence, this paper conducts a systematic research review on the application of machine learning in higher education from an empirical research perspective. Design/methodology/approachThis systematic review examines the application of machine learning (ML) in higher education, focusing on predicting student performance, engagement and self-efficacy. The review covers empirical studies from 2016 to 2024, utilizing a PRISMA framework to select 67 relevant articles from major databases. FindingsThe findings show that ML applications are widely researched and published in high-impact journals. The primary functions of ML in these studies include performance prediction, engagement analysis and self-efficacy assessment, employing various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. Ensemble learning algorithms generally outperform single algorithms regarding accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Common model evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 score, recall and precision, with newer methods also being explored. Research limitations/implicationsFirst, empirical research literature was selected from only four renowned electronic journal databases, and the literature was limited to journal articles, with the latest review literature and conference papers published in the form of conference papers also excluded, which led to empirical research not obtaining the latest views of researchers in interdisciplinary fields. Second, this review focused mainly on the analysis of student grade prediction, learning engagement and self-efficacy and did not study students' risk, dropout rates, retention rates or learning behaviors, which limited the scope of the literature review and the application field of machine learning algorithms. Finally, this article only conducted a systematic review of the application of machine learning algorithms in higher education and did not establish a metadata list or carry out metadata analysis. Originality/valueThe review highlights ML's potential to enhance personalized education, early intervention and identifying at-risk students. Future research should improve prediction accuracy, explore new algorithms and address current study limitations, particularly the narrow focus on specific outcomes and lack of interdisciplinary perspectives.

TI  - Students' engagement with ChatGPT feedback: implications for student feedback literacy in the context of generative artificial intelligence
AU  - Zhan, Y
AU  - Yan, Z
T2  - ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Student feedback engagement is often reported as unsatisfactorily low, undermining the effectiveness of feedback in higher education. The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has created new opportunities to enhance student feedback engagement through its unique affordances. However, assuming that GenAI is a panacea for feedback disengagement can be misleading, as it also presents substantial challenges. Therefore, it is essential to understand how students engage comprehensively with GenAI feedback. However, such understanding is lacking in literature. To close the research gaps, this study investigated how college students engaged with the feedback provided by ChatGPT on their International English Language Testing System writing tasks. Sixteen undergraduates voluntarily participated in unobtrusive observations and stimulated recall interviews. Their feedback engagement was classified into cognitive, metacognitive, affective and behavioural aspects. The findings reveal that participants employed more cognitive strategies than metacognitive ones, experienced minimal emotional resistance, and exhibited varying levels of trust in ChatGPT's feedback. Additionally, the participants' behavioural engagement appeared superficial when requesting feedback, interacting with ChatGPT and revising their writing tasks. Student feedback literacy, including prompt engineering, evaluative judgement, emotional reflexivity, ethical decision-making and meta-cognitive skills, should be cultivated to foster students' active engagement in a GenAI context.

AU  - Podlasov, SO
AU  - Matviichuk, OV
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
AB  - Chat GPT, which was created on the basis of artificial intelligence (AI), posed a number of questions to education, ranging from the most appropriate ways to use it to ways to combat its threats. Answering these questions requires determining the current level of "learning " possessed by ChatGPT in specific knowledge domains, particularly physics studied by students in a bachelor's program at a technical university, and establishing the capabilities of ChatGPT to assist teachers and students in their educational work. The AI, using ChatGPT, considers itself able to assist educators in explaining concepts, answering questions, creating educational content, and supporting research. As for students, the AI believes that ChatGPT is also ready to explain concepts, solve problems, provide additional study materials and advise on exam preparation. For each aspect of assistance to teachers and students (except research support) we posed questions to ChatGPT and analyzed its responses. As it turned out, despite the vast amount of information available to artificial intelligence, in the answers to our queries ChatGPT quit often proposed inaccurate, and sometimes fundamentally incorrect statements, which may indicate the still insufficient level of its knowledge in physics regarding even fairly simple issues. The article presents the most striking examples of such responses. All of this suggests that ChatGPT currently lacks the necessary breadth of knowledge to effectively assist physics teachers and engineering students who study physics at a technical university. Additionally, the study assumes that the accuracy of ChatGPT's answers is determined not only by the content of the question but also by the language in which it is formulated. Based on the analysis of responses, it was concluded that currently it is most appropriate to use GPT for the development of students' critical thinking. The greatest threat posed by ChatGPT to the study of physics can be considered its inadequate level of training, rather than the concerns expressed in the literature that ChatGPT may facilitate students' cheating.

AB  - This study evaluates "I Learn with Prompt Engineering", a self-paced, self-regulated elective course designed to equip university students with skills in prompt engineering to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs), foster self-directed learning, and enhance academic English proficiency through generative AI applications. By integrating prompt engineering concepts with generative AI tools, the course supports autonomous learning and addresses critical skill gaps in language proficiency and market-ready capabilities. The study also examines EnSmart, an AI-driven tool powered by GPT-4 and integrated into Canvas LMS, which automates academic test content generation and grading and delivers real-time, human-like feedback. Performance evaluation, structured questionnaires, and surveys were used to evaluate the course's impact on prompting skills, academic English proficiency, and overall learning experiences. Results demonstrated significant improvements in prompt engineering skills, with accessible patterns like "Persona" proving highly effective, while advanced patterns such as "Flipped Interaction" posed challenges. Gains in academic English were most notable among students with lower initial proficiency, though engagement and practice time varied. Students valued EnSmart's intuitive integration and grading accuracy but identified limitations in question diversity and adaptability. The high final success rate demonstrated that proper course design (taking into consideration Panadero's four dimensions of self-regulated learning) can facilitate successful autonomous learning. The findings highlight generative AI's potential to enhance autonomous learning and task automation, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight for ethical and effective implementation in education.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - This study technically analyses one of the online exam supervision technologies, namely the Artificial Intelligence-based Auto Proctoring (AiAP). This technology has been heavily presented to the academic sectors around the globe. Proctoring technologies are developed to provide oversight and analysis of students' behavior in online exams using AI, and sometimes with the supervision of human proctors to maintain academic integrity. Manual Testing methodology was used to do a software testing on AiAP for verification of any possible incorrect red flags or detections. The study took place in a Middle Eastern university by conducting online exams for 14 different courses, with a total of 244 students. The results were then verified by 5 human proctors in terms of monitoring measurements: screen violation, sound of speech, different faces, multiple faces, and eye movement detection. The proctoring decision was computed by averaging all monitoring measurements and then compared between the human proctors' and the AiAP decisions, to ultimately set the AiAP against a benchmark (human proctoring) and hence to be viable for use. The decision represented the number of violations to the exam conditions, and the result showed a significant difference between Human Decision (average 25.95%) and AiAP Decision (average 35.61%), and the total number of incorrect decisions made by AiAP was 74 out of 244 exam attempts, concluding that AiAP needed some improvements and updates to meet the human level. The researchers provided some technical limitations, privacy concerns, and recommendations to carefully review before deploying and governing such proctoring technologies at institutional level. This paper contributes to the field of educational technology by providing an evidence-based accuracy test on an automatic proctoring software, and the results demand institutional provision to better establish an appropriate online exam experience for higher educational institutions.

AU  - Aldulaijan, AT
AU  - Almalki, SM
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH
AB  - Aim/Purpose This study aimed to investigate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools on postgraduate students' learning experiences. It examined how these students utilize GenAI tools, identified the perceived benefits of their use, and uncovered the challenges students face in their learning experiences with these tools. Background Recent advancements in GenAI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, are transforming how postgraduate students engage with learning, offering new opportunities for academic endeavors. However, understanding how students interact with these tools remains unclear, especially relating to their engagement with activities designed to use GenAI tools as learning assistants. Methodology This study employed a qualitative case study research design, including 11 female postgraduate students enrolled in an educational technology master's program as the primary data collection method. The researchers only had access to female students because of the gender-segregated education system at most Saudi universities. The participants were interviewed after they engaged in a planned activity called Designing a Training Program with GPT Assistance (DTPGA) and unplanned activities involving other GenAI tools. DTPGA is an activity aimed at integrating innovations in training technologies by designing a training program with ChatGPT assistance. Eleven ChatGPT conversation logs and DTPGA activity answers were analyzed based on specific rubrics. The results of the DTPGA activity analysis support the thematic analysis of the interviews. Contribution The key contributions of this study include the design and implementation of a planned activity (DTPGA) to understand how students interact with GenAI tools as learning assistants. Evaluating students' work on a DTPGA activity offers educators a clear vision for assessing GenAI-assisted tasks. In terms of data collection and analysis, this study also offers a deep understanding of the participants' perspectives and actual usage. The study identified two distinct usage patterns of GenAI among students, each classified with its characteristics and implications, shedding light on the diverse ways these tools are integrated into students' learning experiences. Furthermore, the findings provide compelling evidence of the risks associated with misunderstandings that can emerge when students misuse GenAI tools. Findings Students employ GenAI tools to have intellectual conversations, broaden their perspectives, and prototype and test their solutions. The research identified two distinct GenAI usage patterns - the intellectual partner and the information browser - each characterized by unique traits. The first pattern, intellectual partner, uses ChatGPT as a cognitive partner and interacts with it as if it were a real person. This usage tends to be dialogic, collaborative, selectively researching, persistent, and feedback-oriented. The second pattern, information browser, utilizes ChatGPT primarily as a search engine for ideas with the following usage traits: transactional use and illusory understanding. Regarding the perceived benefits, the students appreciated the importance of GenAI tools in enhancing academic skills development, such as academic writing, translation, and self-directed learning. They also acknowledged GenAI tools' role in boosting productivity in routine tasks by optimizing efforts and enhancing efficiency. In creative tasks, they saved time, offered diverse and innovative ideas, and boosted motivation and confidence. However, the perceived drawbacks included concerns about ethical use, a lack of clear guidelines, limited capabilities, overreliance on GenAI, and potential skills erosion. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers These findings will help educators guide students in developing metacognitive awareness and refining their use of GenAI tools while addressing the potential risks. Emphasis should be placed on understanding the distinct patterns of GenAI use, which will enable practitioners to scaffold learners. Integration also requires developing innovative strategies through redesigning lessons and activities and carefully selecting adequate assessment methods that foster critical thinking. Additionally, it is important to enhance learners' skills in effective intellectual communication through GenAI tools, to guide them in evaluating AI- generated content, and to provide ethical frameworks for responsible AI use. Researchers need to explore more innovative strategies to integrate GenAI tools into higher education, in line with the nature of the various disciplines, to use GenAI tools as intellectual partners and not superficially. The field requires further studies to investigate how GenAI tools can be integrated to develop students' intellectual skills, preparing them for future roles that demand advanced abilities and effective use of GenAI for personal and professional growth. Impact on Society This study revealed that the use of GenAI tools has many benefits at the level of individuals in society when interacting with AI tools at an intellectual level. However, the superficial use of GenAI tools may contribute to spreading ignorance and an illusory sense of achievement, which may harm societies. Accordingly, it is necessary to warn users and take necessary measures to avoid superficial and harmful use of GenAI tools by raising individuals' awareness about the effective ways of interacting with GenAI tools and the importance of avoiding overreliance on them without evaluating GenAI outputs. Future Research As several drawbacks associated with GenAI tools have emerged, including superficial technology use and the potential erosion of skills, future studies should explore this aspect and its impact on learning in greater depth. Future studies could employ a mixed-methods study design with a larger sample encompassing both males and females to enhance the generalizability of the findings.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH
AB  - Aim/PurposeTo gain insight into the opinions and reviews of Malaysian university students regarding e-learning systems, thereby improving the quality and services of these systems and resolving any problems, concerns, and issues that may exist within the institution.BackgroundThis exploratory study examines the students' perceptions of e-learning in Ma-laysia based on Sentiment Analysis (SA) to gain a clear insight into their feelings about the quality of e-learning systems and related services in Malaysian univer-sities to determine whether these opinions are positive or negative.MethodologyThe data was collected from Twitter; the Full Archive Search API Premium v1.1 tire was chosen to access the tweets from November 1, 2019, to December 30, 2020. The R programming language library package "rtweet" was applied to ac-cess the search API and query the tweets. To classify students' opinions, senti-ment analysis-based Machine Learning (ML) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized. Rapid Miner, a statistical and data mining tool, was used to determine the sentiment of tweets and the accuracy of the ML algorithm. After preparing the data, RapidMiner was used to pre-process and classify the final 1201 tweets based on sentiment, and National Research Council (NRC) word-emotion lexicon was used to detect the presence of eight emotions in the tweets. The confusion matrix is used to determine the classifier's performance. Contribution This research provided evidence for the effective use of sentiment analysis as an indicator that may contribute to the development of educational systems, specifically, e-learning systems in Malaysian universities.Findings Based on the findings, the majority of students have a positive opinion about e -learning systems in Malaysian universities. Precisely, the results showed that 65% of sentiments were classified as positive and 35% as negative. Moreover, among the eight emotions, the majority of the tweets expressed a higher level of trust, anticipation, and joy.Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers The study findings could help classify the teachers' strengths and weaknesses graphically based on the students' positive and negative feedback. These find-ings would also help decision-makers and educationalists be more aware of stu-dents' feelings (sentiments) and concerns. Thus, using social media sentiment analysis should be encouraged as a valuable source of information that may as-sist their educational decision-making, e-learning development, and perfor-mance evaluation. The findings may encourage other researchers to apply SA based ML approach and use Twitter as a data source to discover users' opinions about certain issues in learning and teaching processes.Impact on Society Our study confirmed that social media data could provide valuable and support-ive information about educational systems and procedures in e-learning for ap-propriate decision-making regarding future development and strategies.Future Research Future work can experiment with other classification models and different ML classification algorithms as well as other feature extraction methods and com-pare the results to find the best accuracy that can improve the classification re-sults

The COVID-19 has disrupted the normal teaching-learning role across the world and has put everyone in a nightmare. HEIs are now requesting students to take up MOOCs to explore and attain knowledge and the same is even followed by the corporate institutions. MOOCs are one of the crisis management solutions to ensure that education is continuous and not disrupted. Design/methodology/approach The data included in this research has been collected from students of HEIs across India using a convenient sampling method. The collected data was exposed to a factor analysis using a principal component analysis (PCA) technique to reduce multiple dimensions. Findings The various stakeholders such as the government, HEIs and the MOOC providers have to play a crucial role in developing intellectual human assets for the nation's growth and progression by extending flexible and cost-effective learning facilities. Education should be free to boost up the learning motivation, and hence it is the responsibility of the stakeholders to provide few courses free of cost, which will increase the rate of enrolment and student participation. Research limitations/implications From the research, it is well understood that MOOCs are useful to keep oneself updated with the market and industry trends especially when the world is focusing on business analytics, artificial intelligence and other technologically driven topics and concepts. Practical implications The present study contributes to the growing body of evidence that MOOCs play an important role in providing flexibility in learning. In the future, if there are similar crisis, which will disrupt education, then the best alternative will be MOOC through which many stakeholders will benefit. Education should be free to boost up the learning motivation, and hence it is the responsibility of the stakeholders to provide few courses free of cost, which will increase the rate of enrolment and student participation. Social implications Education is a service for the society which will have a long-term positive impact on improving the standard of living of the people. Hence, MOOCs can be one of the educational elements to provide learning opportunities to all age groups. Originality/value This study has explored the perception of MOOCs among the students of HEIs in India in the COVID-19 pandemic. The fresh data collected from the students is a reflection of their experiences during the COVID-19 lockdown.

AB  - PurposeAn evidence-based approach to improving instructional practices and student outcomes in data use. It is a systematic process of evaluating and analysing learning problems, collecting and transforming various types of data into instructional decisions, and implementing informed actions to improve instruction and student learning. Since teachers are the main actors in instructional practices, this article reports on a study aimed at predicting the influence of various teachers' characteristics on the degree of data use practices for instructional purposes.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, we conducted a survey in a developing country to gather primary data. The collected data were analysed using a supervised machine learning approach, focussing on decision tree analysis, to determine the influential factors.FindingsOur investigation identifies pedagogical knowledge, data literacy, content knowledge, knowledge of English for teaching and attitudes towards data as crucial determinants in predicting the intensity of such data use practices. Notably, pedagogical knowledge emerges as the most potent predictor, emphasising its pivotal role in shaping teachers' frequency of instructional data use practices. Surprisingly, English proficiency does not exhibit a significant influence in this predictive model.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings may not be generalisable to a wider context since this study relied on a relatively small teacher self-reported sample collected through surveys, and, as this study used perception data, this may or may not reflect teachers' actual knowledge and skills.Practical implicationsBy spotlighting the nuanced interplay between teacher individual characteristics and the practice of data use for instructional improvement, this research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the factors shaping teachers' engagement with data. Ultimately, it provides a foundation for targeted interventions and strategies aimed at fostering a culture of evidence-based practices to improve instruction and consequently student learning outcomes within educational settings.Social implicationsThis insight holds significant implications for policymakers, educational practitioners and providers of professional development programmes seeking to facilitate effective data use practices for instructional improvement.Originality/valueBy spotlighting the nuanced interplay between teacher individual characteristics and the practice of data use for instructional purposes, this research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the factors shaping teachers' engagement with data. This study represents an empirical examination of such factors by employing a quantitative approach: a flexible decision tree analysis. This contributes to a growing body of research on factors related to teacher characteristics and much of the research in the field of data use has been done using a qualitative approach.

AB  - This study examines how university students in Portugal and Spain perceive the quality of journalistic news produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI). As AI—particularly generative models like ChatGPT-3—becomes increasingly integrated into news distribution and newsroom operations, it offers the promise of greater efficiency and the reduction of non-value-added tasks. However, its rise also raises concerns about potential risks, ethical implications, and the evolving relationship between human journalists and AI-driven content creation. The study focuses on the perceptions of journalism students, addressing key research questions related to their ability to discern AI-generated news, comparing the quality between AI-generated news and news written by journalists, and the influence of news topics in assessing quality. We applied two surveys to 444 participants, evaluating dimensions of news quality, such as readability, informativeness and style. The findings indicate that students generally rated news generated by ChatGPT-3 as being of higher quality than news written by journalists. Students in Spain gave higher ratings to AI-generated news. The findings suggest a potential shift in perceptions of news quality, promoting discussions about the evolving role of AI in journalism education and its broader implications for the industry. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots such as ChatGPT have capabilities across numerous domains. Teachers and students have been increasingly using chatbots in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in various ways, including for assessment purposes. However, there has been a lack of systematic investigation into LLMs’ capabilities and limitations in automatically generating items for STEM subject assessments, especially given that LLMs can hallucinate and may risk promoting misconceptions and hindering conceptual understanding. To address this, we systematically investigated LLMs' conceptual understanding and quality of working in generating question and answer pairs across various STEM subjects. We used prompt engineering on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with three different approaches: standard prompting, standard prompting with added chain-of-thought prompting using worked examples with steps, and the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language. The questions and answer pairs were generated at the pre-university level in the three STEM subjects of chemistry, physics, and mathematics and evaluated by subject-matter experts. We found that LLMs generated quality questions when using the chain-of-thought prompting for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and when using the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 overall. However, there were varying patterns in generating multistep answers, with differences in final answer and intermediate step accuracy. An interesting finding was that the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other approaches in generating correct final answers while demonstrating moderate accuracy in generating multistep answers correctly. In addition, through qualitative analysis, we identified domain-specific prompting patterns across the three STEM subjects. We then discussed how our findings aligned with, contradicted, and contributed to the current body of knowledge on automatic item generation research using LLMs, and the implications for teachers using LLMs to generate STEM assessment items. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - What influences college students using AI for academic writing? - A quantitative analysis based on HISAM and TRI theory
AU  - Cui, Y.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely adopted as tools for academic writing, sparking interest in the factors that influence their adoption. However, existing research has predominantly focused on cognitive factors, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, while giving insufficient attention to emotional motivations (e.g., perceived enjoyment, emotional engagement) in students' use of AI tools. This gap has led to a somewhat oversimplified or incomplete understanding of the factors influencing students' adoption of AI technologies. This study constructs a theoretical framework based on the Hedonic Information System Acceptance Model (HISAM) and the Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data from 148 university students. The study finds that students' intention to use AI tools is influenced not only by cognitive evaluations, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, but also by emotional factors, including technological optimism and perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment, as a positive emotional factor in the interaction process, significantly promotes students' usage intention. Additionally, technological optimism, as a positive aspect of technology readiness, has a direct positive effect on perceived enjoyment. Furthermore, although negative experiences such as technical discomfort and insecurity have a minor impact on the evaluation of AI tool functionality, they still affect students' emotional experiences, thereby influencing their usage intention. The study suggests that future AI tool designs should prioritize enhancing students' emotional experiences by providing personalized feedback and optimizing user interfaces to improve ease of use. Moreover, increasing the tool's interpretability and transparency can help reduce the risks of misuse, such as academic dishonesty or a decline in learning ability, which may arise from negative emotional experiences. © 2025 The Author

TI  - Deep learning-based strategies for evaluating and enhancing university teaching quality
AU  - Gao, Y.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The education sector currently faces several challenges, including the subjectivity of evaluation methods, uniformity of data, and a lack of real-time feedback. This study aims to address these issues by leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately assess and enhance the quality of university teaching. In contrast to traditional teaching quality assessment methods, which often lack rigor and comprehensiveness, this study introduces a precise and thorough evaluation framework. By integrating deep learning algorithms, the study seeks to improve the objectivity and accuracy of evaluations, facilitate personalized feedback, and foster innovation in teaching methodologies. The research process involves multiple complex stages, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model construction, training, validation, and results analysis. Multi-source data—comprising student performance data, teacher evaluations, course content, and student feedback—are used to create a robust dataset. Data encoding, standardization, and feature engineering techniques are employed to enhance model input. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN model achieves prediction accuracies of 92% for “Excellent,” 88% for “Good,” 85% for “Average,” and 80% for “Poor” in the test set. These results underscore the model's high performance in classification tasks, particularly in accurately identifying high-quality teaching, with both high precision and recall. This study not only addresses a gap in the field by utilizing multi-source data for comprehensive evaluation but also validates the effectiveness of deep learning models in assessing teaching quality. Additionally, the study provides a foundation for developing targeted teaching improvement strategies. © 2025 The Author

AB  - Energy poverty remains a critical issue in Bangladesh, with substantial disparities in access to energy services across socio-economic and geographic groups. This study explores the socio-demographic factors driving multidimensional energy poverty and evaluates the potential of machine learning (ML) models to improve the predictive accuracy of the multidimensional energy poverty index score compared to traditional statistical models. Using national survey data, we first applied binary logistic regression to identify key determinants, such as division, place of residence, education, and financial inclusion. The results indicate that rural households, particularly in Rangpur and Barisal, face a significantly higher risk of energy poverty. In contrast, higher education and access to financial services are associated with reduced energy deprivation. Recognizing the limitations of traditional statistical models in capturing complex, nonlinear interactions and multicollinearity among socio-demographic factors, we implemented six ML algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks—to enhance predictive precision. The models demonstrated consistently high accuracy, with geographic and socio-economic factors like division, education and financial inclusion emerging as the most important predictors. Our findings emphasize the need for targeted energy policies, especially in rural areas and disadvantaged divisions. Promoting financial inclusion and improving educational access are recommended as effective strategies to further alleviate energy poverty. While the study provides valuable insights, it acknowledges the limitations of cross-sectional data and calls for further research using longitudinal approaches and an analysis of institutional factors. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the determinants of the sustainable use of artificial intelligence (AI) among university professors in Peru. This research adopted a quantitative approach through a cross-sectional empirical–explanatory study, employing a structural equation model. Data were collected from 368 professors from eight Peruvian universities using a structured questionnaire that assessed six main constructs: attitude toward AI, prejudice against AI, facilitating conditions, use of AI, teaching concerns, and ethical perception. While the results reveal significant correlational relationships—with attitude toward AI, facilitating conditions, and prejudice against AI showing a significant association with its sustainable use, and the use of AI showing a significant relationship with professors’ ethical perceptions—the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes causal inferences. No significant relationship was found between the use of AI and teaching concerns. Additionally, demographic variables such as gender and age did not exhibit significant moderating effects. These findings contribute to understanding the factors related to the sustainable adoption of AI in higher education and provide valuable insights for the development of effective institutional strategies in the Latin American context. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has generated excitement and concern in education. While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - "Do EFL Learners Need AI?": Exploring Learners' Perspectives on the Use of ChatGPT for Morphology and Syntax Learning Tasks
AU  - Dewanti, R.
AU  - Iskandar, I.
AU  - Yasin, Y.
T2  - Forum for Linguistic Studies
AB  - This study investigates English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ perspectives on using ChatGPT for English morphology and syntax learning tasks. Data were collected from 24 EFL learners enrolled in an English Morphology and Syntax course at a university in Jakarta, Indonesia, through weekly progress reports and a focus group discussion. The findings reveal that learners utilize ChatGPT for various purposes, including simplifying, confirming, elaborating, previewing, and supplementing course materials. While learners generally hold positive perceptions of ChatGPT, concerns regarding its accuracy and its limitations in morphological and morphemic analysis were noted. The study indicates that while ChatGPT can assist with basic explanations and concepts, it struggles with complex linguistic analysis, making it a supplementary tool rather than a substitute for textbooks or instructors. Learners expressed the need for improved citation references and multimodal support in ChatGPT, as well as more reliable information. These findings provide empirical evidence of ChatGPT’s role in EFL linguistic learning, showing its potential to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing its limitations. The study suggests that ChatGPT, when used appropriately, can support EFL learners in understanding linguistic concepts but cannot replace the traditional classroom learning environment. The study also offers insights for future pedagogical strategies to effectively integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into linguistics education. Copyright © 2025 by the author(s)

T2  - Education for Chemical Engineers
AB  - With the recent and rapid growth of the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including the use of large language models (LLMs) there has been growing concern amongst higher education institutions regarding assessment, potential plagiarism, and ultimately a negative impact on student learning outcomes. However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output. As such, this work provides not just a case study for the integration of LLMs, and GAI more broadly, into chemical engineering curricula, but also valuable insight into student perceptions regarding the use of this nascent technology more generally. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) has brought opportunities and challenges for higher education as it integrates into teaching and learning environments. As instructors navigate this new landscape, understanding their engagement with and attitudes toward GenAI is crucial. We surveyed 178 instructors from a single U.S. university to examine their current practices, perceptions, trust, and distrust of GenAI in higher education in March 2024. While most surveyed instructors reported moderate to high familiarity with GenAI-related concepts, their actual use of GenAI tools for direct instructional tasks remained limited. Our quantitative results show that trust and distrust in GenAI are related yet distinct; high trust does not necessarily imply low distrust, and vice versa. We also found significant differences in surveyed instructors' familiarity with GenAI across different trust and distrust groups. Our qualitative results show nuanced manifestations of trust and distrust among surveyed instructors and various approaches to support calibrated trust in GenAI. We discuss practical implications focused on (dis)trust calibration among instructors. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - This research presents the theoretical bases and practical experiences in Vietnam in applying machine learning to support adults in educating 0-to 36-month-old children at home. The paper also reports the findings of a scientific research project named “Researching and applying machine learning to support adults to educate young children aged 0-36 months in their families” at Vietnam National University, Hanoi. To be more specific, the authors have designed an AI-driven chatbot which acts as a babysitter to provide information and answer frequently-asked questions regarding at-home education of 0-to 36-month-old children following prevalent scripts or data. For simple questions the AI-driven babysitter chatbot will offer the answers on their own. For more complex ones, the chatbot will send them to teachers for solutions. During the process, the chatbot will do self-learning to enhance its ability to give more accurate and practical answers. Experiments show that the chatbot designed by the authors has successfully addressed limitations of the conventional counterparts. Additionally, it also provides accurate and reliable answers, as well as enhanced user experience thanks to trusted references and parents’ coordination in effective child education, ensuring quality and authenticity. © 2025, Transnational Press London Ltd.

T2  - Nurse Education in Practice
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to explore the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students' use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their studies, examining how this usage shapes their learning experiences and perceptions of traditional pedagogical approaches. Background: The integration of AI into healthcare is rapidly transforming clinical practice, which in turn necessitates a corresponding shift in nursing education. While AI's potential benefits and challenges in education are widely discussed, limited research has focused on how nursing students specifically use these tools in their nursing studies and how this impacts their learning processes. Design: A qualitative study employing exploratory and descriptive designs. Methods: Participants were recruited from an undergraduate nursing program at a tertiary university. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data. Results: Key findings revealed that nursing students use AI for personalized learning, bridging the theory-practice gap and managing time constraints. International students particularly found AI valuable for cultural adaptation and language support. A significant finding was the “open secret” of AI use, with students actively using tools despite institutional discouragement, highlighting a disconnect between student needs and institutional practices. Ethical concerns, such as bias, data privacy and accountability, were also prominent. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into the student-driven demand for AI integration in nursing education. It highlights the need for institutional responsiveness, transparency and the development of ethical AI frameworks. By acknowledging student agency and fostering collaborative dialogue, nursing education can leverage AI's benefits effectively while upholding the profession's core values: compassion, empathy and human-centered care. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - English Teaching (South Korea)
AB  - The present study investigates the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools by pre-service teachers (PSTs) in lesson planning for a middle-school English as a foreign language (EFL) class, aiming to address gaps and inform teacher training. The case study examined PSTs in a South Korean university course who were tasked with creating lesson plans using generative AI to aid in lesson plan development for a middle school lesson that incorporated generative AI. Data were analyzed thematically, and results revealed that generative AI was used in topic selection, material creation, lesson organization, and language checking. While generative AI facilitated efficiency and creativity, challenges emerged, including the quality of outputs and limited incorporation of effective pedagogical strategies. These findings indicate a need for targeted training in prompt engineering, ethical considerations, pedagogy, and collaborative practices to enhance PSTs’ generative AI competencies. This study contributes to teacher education programs by providing insights into the practical integration of generative AI in pedagogical practices. © 2025 The Korea Association of Teachers of English (KATE)

AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of the freely accessible artificial intelligence chatbots (AICB) that might disrupt the teaching and learning pattern in higher education. While some education stakeholders developed strong opposition towards the AICB usage, condemning it as academic dishonesty, there are others believe the AICB might even improve the students’ learning. A total of 160 urban college students were purposively selected and requested to respond to the scales of ChatGPT acceptance and trust, academic self-efficacy, and university mattering to test the hypothesis that the acceptance and trust towards AICB should improve academic self-efficacy and general mattering among the students. The results indicated that academic self-efficacy partially mediates the contribution of AICB on the societal mattering. In other words, the findings suggest that students who trust and accept AICB usage would likely to believe that they can perform academically better and therefore they feel they are more meaningful to the society. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2025, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

RQ2: What are user preferences for embodied voice interfaces (EVIs), and do their preferred EVIs influence their decision to switch the voice on their VAs? RQ3: What are the users’ perceptions of their VAs concerning: a. information accuracy, b. usefulness, c. intelligence and d. the most important characteristics they must possess? RQ4: Do users prefer their voice interface to match their characteristics (age, gender, accent and race/ethnicity)? Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a 52-question survey questionnaire to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The population was undergraduate students (freshmen and sophomores) at a research university in the USA. The students were enrolled in two required courses with a research participation assignment offered for credits. Students must register for research participation credits in the SONA Research Participation System www.sona-systems.com/platform/research-management/ Registered students cannot be invited or sampled to participate in a research study. There were 1,700 students enrolled in both courses. After the survey’s URL was posted in SONA, the authors received (n = 632) responses. Of these, (n = 150) completed the survey and provided valid responses. Findings: Participants (43%) switched the voice interface in their VAs. They preferred American and British accents but trusted the latter. The British accent with a male voice was more trusted than the American accent with a female voice. Voice-switching decisions varied in the case of most and least preferred EVIs. Participants preferred EVIs that matched their characteristics. Most trusted their VAs’ information accuracy because they used the internet to find information, reflecting inadequate mental models. Lack of trust is attributed to misunderstanding requests and inability to respond accurately. A significant correlation was found between the participants’ perceived intelligence of their VAs and trust in information accuracy. Research limitations/implications: Due to the wide variability in the data (e.g. 84% White, 6% Asian and 6% Black), the authors did not perform a statistical test to identify the significance between the selected EVIs and participants’ races or ethnicities. The self-reported survey questionnaire may be prone to inaccuracy. The participants’ interest in earning research credit for participation in this study and using SONA is a potential bias. The EVIs the authors used as embodiments are limited in their representation of people from diverse backgrounds, races, ethnicities, ages and genders. However, they could be examples for building prototypes to test in VAs. Practical implications: Educators and information professionals should lead the way in offering artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programs to enable young adults to form more adequate mental models of VAs and support their learning and interactions. VA designers should address the failures and other issues the participants experienced in VAs to minimize frustrations. They should also train machine learning models on large data sets of complex queries to augment success. Furthermore, they should consider augmenting VAs’ personification with EVIs to enrich voice interactions and enhance personalization. Researchers should use a mixed research method with data triangulation instead of only a survey. Social implications: There is a dire need to teach young adults AI literacy skills to enable them to build adequate mental models of VAs. Failures in VAs could affect users’ willingness to use them in the future. VAs can be effective teaching and learning tools, supporting students’ autonomous and personalized learning. Integrating EVIs with diverse characteristics could advance inclusivity in designing VAs and support personalization beyond language, accent and gender. Originality/value: This study advances research on user voice-switching behavior in VAs, which has hardly been investigated in VA research. It brings attention to users’ experiential learning and the need for exposure to AI literacy to enable them to form adequate mental models of VAs. This study contributes to research on personifying VAs through EVIs with diverse characteristics to visualize voice interactions. Reasons for not switching the voice interface due to satisfaction with the current voice or a lack of knowledge of this feature did not support the status quo theory. Incorporating satisfaction and lack of knowledge as new factors could advance this theory. Switching the voice interface to avoid visualizing the least preferred EVIs in VAs is a new theme emerging from this study. Users’ trust in VAs’ information accuracy is intertwined with perceived intelligence and usefulness, but perceived intelligence is the strongest factor influencing trust. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - European Journal of Educational Research
AB  - This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) integration on students' educational experiences. It investigates student perceptions of AI across various academic aspects, such as module outlines, learning outcomes, curriculum design, instructional activities, assessments, and feedback mechanisms. It evaluates the impact of AI on students' learning experiences, critical thinking, self-assessment, cognitive development, and academic integrity. This research used a structured survey distributed to 300 students through Microsoft Forms 365, yet the response rate was 29.67%. A structured survey and thematic analysis were employed to gather insights from 89 students. Thematic analysis is a qualitative method for identifying and analysing patterns or themes within data, providing insights into key ideas and trends. The limited response rate may be attributed to learners' cultural backgrounds, as not all students are interested in research or familiar with AI tools. The survey questions are about AI integration in different academic areas. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and themes within the data. Benefits such as enhanced critical thinking, timely feedback, and personalised learning experiences are prevalent. AI tools like Turnitin supported academic integrity, and platforms like ChatGPT and Grammarly were particularly valued for their utility in academic tasks. The study acknowledges limitations linked to the small sample size and a focus on undergraduate learners only. The findings suggest that AI can significantly improve educational experiences. AI provides tailored support and promotes ethical practices. This study recommends continued and expanded use of AI technologies in education while addressing potential implementation challenges. © 2025 The Author(s).

AU  - Dinh, C.T.
T2  - FWU Journal of Social Sciences
AB  - This study investigates undergraduate English majors' perceptions of ChatGPT in enhancing vocabulary and grammar in academic writing. Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent design, data were collected from 31 students via pre-and post-survey questionnaires, 20 participants’ reflective journals, and semi-structured interviews with 10 volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed significant improvements in students’ perceptions of vocabulary accuracy, relevance, and depth. Thematic analysis of qualitative data identified benefits such as enriched vocabulary, improved grammatical accuracy, and increased confidence in academic writing. Challenges included overdependence, difficulty interpreting feedback, and a lack of originality in AI-generated suggestions. Students employed strategies to optimize ChatGPT use, such as asking specific questions, selectively applying feedback, and balancing AI input with personal judgment. The study highlights ChatGPT's ability to provide tailored feedback, foster confidence, and support vocabulary development while underscoring the importance of responsible use to mitigate overreliance and maintain originality. The findings underscore ChatGPT's potential to enhance academic writing skills when integrated thoughtfully into curricula. However, overuse risks shallow learning (e.g., overdependence on the tool, or difficulty in interpreting feedback), suggesting a need for instructional strategies that can promote rigorous analysis with AI tools. Future research should explore long-term impacts, comparisons with other AI tools, and strategies for ethical and effective integration of ChatGPT in higher education. © 2025, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University.

T2  - Computer Standards and Interfaces
AB  - By enhancing user authentication protocols, especially in critical infrastructures vulnerable to complex cyberthreats, we present an advanced approach that integrates a deep learning-based model and data fusion techniques applied to analyze keystroke dynamics. With the growing need for robust security measures, especially in critical infrastructure environments, traditional authentication mechanisms often fail to cope with advanced threats. Our approach focuses on the unique behavioral biometric characteristics of keystrokes, which offers promising opportunities to improve user authentication processes. We have developed a data fusion-based methodology that utilizes the unique features of keystroke dynamics combined with deep learning techniques to improve user authentication systems. Using the capabilities of data fusion and deep learning, the proposed methodology not only captures the complex behavioral biometrics inherent in keystroke dynamics but also addresses the challenges posed by varying password lengths and typing styles. We conducted extensive experiments on several fixed-text datasets, including the Carnegie Mellon University dataset, the KeyRecs dataset, and the GREYC-NISLAB dataset, with a total of approximately 54,000 password records. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets with different password lengths have shown that our approach is scalable and accurate for user authentication, which significantly improves the security of critical infrastructure. By using interpolation-based data fusion techniques to standardize the keystroke data to a uniform length and employing a Siamese neural network with a triplet loss function, the best equal error rate of 0.13281 was achieved for the unseen fused data. The integration of deep learning and data fusion effectively generalizes to different user profiles, demonstrating its adaptability and accuracy in authenticating users in different scenarios. The findings are crucial for improving security in sensitive applications, ranging from accessing personal devices to protecting critical infrastructure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - Researchers conduct (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) SWOT analysis studies to outline the four significant components related to a pressing issue: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This qualitative study employed SWOT analysis to examine the practices of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technologies in higher educational institutions in Oman. To this end, six instructors from different universities across the country were interviewed, and their insights were analysed to extract the themes that were subsequently analysed considering the SWOT framework. Several strengths were identified, including the use of AI-powered tools in making decisions, facilitating personalized learning, and performing routine tasks, which allow the instructors to do other, more critical tasks. Concerning the weaknesses, the interviewed educators pointed to the likelihood that students will become excessively dependent on AI tools, adversely affecting their learning and cognition development. Opportunities included fostering further personalized instruction and increased humanization support. Threats encompassed concerns regarding the high costs of AI technologies, the need for providing the necessary in-service training, and concerns related to ethical issues and data privacy. The findings emphasized the need to stress the significance of offering ongoing training to the faculty members and administrators, coupled with promoting the educators' involvement in decisions regarding AI applications and developing guidelines to address ethical concerns. The findings of the study highlight critical areas not only for the intervention of policymakers but also to serve as a springboard for future studies to enable them to explore strategies for adapting AI, for framing ethical regulations, and for fostering long-term impacts on teaching and learning. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.

T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) uptake in South Africa’s social services sector offers transformative opportunities for improving education, training, and service delivery. However, the social service sector has yet to utilize AI’s opportunities and benefits. This paper examined the accelerators and inhibitors influencing AI adoption. Through a scoping review, thirty-five studies were analyzed. The findings highlighted accelerators of AI uptake being supportive policies such as the Windhoek Statement on AI and the National Digital and Future Skills Strategy, which promote digital literacy, innovation, and AI integration in higher education, growing research on AI applications, internet connectivity, and digital literacy. However, inhibitors included socio-economic disparities, lack of adequate infrastructure, ethical concerns regarding data privacy, and fears of AI replacing human jobs. Moreover, according to the findings, social service professionals lack the digital skills and confidence to adopt AI technologies and ethical challenges surrounding AI’s role in human-centered fields. The study concludes that South Africa is on the right trajectory towards the uptake of AI, and the social service sectors will benefit through enhanced efficiency, personalized learning for professionals, and administrative improvements. The study recommends increased investment in digital infrastructure, comprehensive training for social service professionals, and developing ethical frameworks that ensure AI is used responsibly and equitably. © 2025 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

TI  - From hype to strategy: navigating the reality of experimental strategic adoption of AI technologies in libraries
AU  - Gupta, V.
T2  - Reference Services Review
AB  - Purpose: The article highlights the value of adopting an experimental strategy for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in libraries, with a specific focus on the University of Toronto (UofT) libraries as a case study. The experimental approach entails carrying out small-scale, effective, quick, and reversible experiments to increase awareness, reduce risks with adoption of incorrect, ineffective, or full-scale adoption; increase flexibility in adopting new technologies in the rapidly evolving AI industry; and increase open-mindedness to consider diverse perspectives even though they go against one’s held perceptions, and develop dynamic capabilities to innovate. To fully realize the revolutionary potential of AI technologies in libraries, it is crucial to adopt new technologies strategically, driven by experimentation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed-model research involving case study of UofT libraries and the author’s professional experiences in digitally transforming libraries is used to answer the research question. AI is an emerging area and hence its applications in libraries. Leveraging the author’s professional and research expertise, the findings from the case study are enriched, offering broader perspectives and more nuanced implications. Findings: Libraries can recognize emerging opportunities, adapt to the shifting AI landscape, and effectively exploit AI technologies because of the development of dynamic capabilities and a focus on innovation. The UofT instance sheds light on the experimental strategy and acts as a lens to comprehend how to strategically think about the complete AI spectrum rather than keeping an eye on a few technologies that otherwise might just be overhyped in media outlets. A mix of centralization and decentralization of AI technology adoption experimentation is evident at UOT, where any librarian is free to test out a new tool and share their findings with their peers in the expectation that other libraries will embrace it as well. The reverse scenario is also conceivable (top management to individual libraries). UofT’s culture fosters collaboration and knowledge-sharing among librarians, promoting experimentation and innovation. Cocreation with patrons, including student entrepreneurs, enhances dynamic capabilities and informs rational adoption decisions. Looking at the results, some future research directions emerge that could strengthen the library’s focus on AI. The future research directions indicate the need for further investigation into experiment design, particularly focusing on experimentation policies, monitoring and evaluation of experimentation activities, and fostering greater collaboration with patrons. Additionally, exploring AI adoption factors at both organizational and individual levels is essential to create a supportive environment for these experiments. Conducting continuous AI experiments enables librarians to critically assess AI technologies by leveraging their experiences with various applications, allowing them to distinguish practical solutions from market hype and concentrate on options that truly enhance their library operations. Practical implications: The article contributes to the knowledge of strategic AI technology adoption and the role of experimentation in libraries’ adoption of AI technologies. This paper offers practical guidance for libraries of all sizes and resource levels seeking to experiment with AI technologies. It encourages the creation of a collaborative environment where patrons and peers can come together to experiment and share knowledge. Additionally, it encourages libraries to explore various research directions—such as defining experimentation policies, integrating monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess the effectiveness of experiments, fostering collaboration, and leveraging AI adoption factors—to cultivate a culture of experimentation. This approach aims to increase the number of experiments and, consequently, the adoption of valuable AI technologies. Originality/value: AI in libraries is rapidly evolving, but current literature remains underdeveloped and lacks comprehensive adoption frameworks. Investigating individual libraries’ AI practices and sharing these insights will enable collaborative learning, helping them improve overall adoption process, fostering further innovation with emerging technologies, and helping in development of a theoretical foundation or maturity of AI domain. The research outcomes hold significant value for a wide range of libraries, from those hesitant to adopt AI due to ethical concerns to those actively experimenting with AI technologies. The article uniquely recommends further research at the intersection of library AI-driven digital transformations, cocreation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), adoption models, and AI experimentation policies that ethically balances library innovation focus and data privacies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - Forum for Linguistic Studies
AB  - The emergence of ChatGPT has revolutionized foreign language education, offering various benefits. However, limited research exists on the practical advantages and challenges of employing ChatGPT in teaching and learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL). This study explores the perceptions of EFL Saudi teachers regarding the integration of ChatGPT into English language teaching within the Saudi context. Using an interpretive qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 female EFL teachers at Al-Manar University. The findings indicate that participants generally held positive views of ChatGPT, appreciating its utility in lesson planning, designing activities, and creating assessments. Teachers emphasized that ChatGPT enhances efficiency, engagement, and interactivity in the classroom. However, concerns were raised regarding its credibility and the potential for students to become overly dependent on it, leading to diminished skills and abilities in critical thinking, independent learning, and emotional intelligence. These limitations highlight the need for a balanced approach to integrating ChatGPT into teaching practices. This study addresses a gap in the literature by focusing on the unique cultural and educational perspectives of Saudi EFL teachers, offering insights into how Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can be tailored to specific educational contexts. The findings underscore the importance of professional development for teachers to promote responsible AI use and encourage student-centered learning. Implications for practice and future research directions are discussed. Copyright © 2025 by the author(s).

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education, including how students approach examinations. This study addresses the growing reliance on AI in academic settings and its implications for learning and assessment integrity. The study aimed to analyze student reliance on AI in finding answers to midterm and final exams at the Ibnu Rusyd College of Tarbiyah (IRCT) Tanah Grogot, Indonesia. The research employed a mixed-methods approach through a survey of 98 Islamic Education Study Program students and interviews with 5 lecturers and 20 students. Data were analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis. The results show that 70% of the students utilized AI occasionally or frequently to complete exams, citing efficiency and ease of access. However, only 30% of the students felt that the use of AI supported an in-depth understanding of the material. Conversely, the lecturers highlighted that the overuse of AI risks reducing students' analytical skills. Quantitative analysis showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.45) between AI use and academic outcomes, while regression analysis revealed that other factors, such as lecturer guidance and learning motivation, were more significant in influencing academic success. This study recommends establishing clear institutional policies to regulate AI use, including a proctoring system in technology-based exams and the implementation of project-based learning to reduce student dependency on AI. Additionally, this study contributes novel insights into the ethical considerations of AI use in education and suggests that future research should explore the long-term behavioral impacts of AI reliance on student learning outcomes. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.

Although important questions have surfaced surrounding the varied effects on writing instruction and ethical implications of AI in the classroom, there are calls for deeper investigations about how these tools might shape multimodal composing processes. This study builds upon this developing field by exploring how 21 university students in literacy education courses multimodally composed with generative AI and their perspectives on the use of AI in the classroom. Data sources included screen capture and video observations, design interviews, pre- and post- surveys, and multimodal products. Through qualitative and multimodal analysis, four main themes emerged for understanding preservice teachers’ multimodal composing processes: (1) composing was an iterative process of prompting guided by the AI tools, (2) composers exhibited two distinct processes when designing their projects, (3) AI shaped creative possibilities, and (4) play, humor, and surprise served a key function while composing. Preservice teachers’ perspectives also revealed insights into how AI shaped engagement with content, the importance of scaffolding AI in the classroom, and how ethics were intertwined with technical function and teaching beliefs. © 2024

TI  - Chinese University Major Decision and Its Effect on Wages: Modeling Interaction Between Major Specificity and Education-Job Relevancy Using Machine Learning Approaches
AU  - Hang, T.

T2  - Journal of Chinese Political Science
AB  - China’s expanding access to higher education and economic slowdown have resulted in growing social concerns about employment opportunities for fresh graduates. This study investigates the effect of choice of major on starting wages in the Chinese labor market. Analyzing a sample of 45,000 observations from Nanjing, China, we use machine learning techniques to uncover a significant interaction between major specificity (i.e. the specificity of the knowledge and skills each major entails) and education-job relevancy in determining wages. We first take the OLS and Heckman models as the baseline, before employing the KNN and Random Forest model fits. The interaction is then measured by the adjusted Friedman’s H-index and finally visualized by network plots and thermal graphs. This research achieves three goals. First, we find that family background, measured by hukou and/or parent education, has no significant impact on major selection and university tier. This finding not only address potential endogeneity concerns, but also has important implications for the study of class mobility in contemporary China. Specifically, it indicates that the impact of the rural-urban social stratification created by the hukou policy has diminished, and that China’s higher education system facilitates social equity. Second, this is the first study to use innovative methods to examine the pricing of 206 specific majors in the Chinese labor market. Third, this research provides guidance for individuals choosing their major, governments concerned with educational resource allocation and employment opportunities, and foreign scholars with limited knowledge of China’s graduate job market. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Advances in Physiology Education
AB  - Generative large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can quickly produce informative essays on various topics. However, the information generated cannot be fully trusted, as artificial intelligence (AI) can make factual mistakes. This poses challenges for using such tools in college classrooms. To address this, an adaptable assignment called the ChatGPT Fact-Check was developed to teach students in college science courses the benefits of using LLMs for topic exploration while emphasizing the importance of validating their claims based on evidence. The assignment requires students to use ChatGPT to generate essays, evaluate AI-generated sources, and assess the validity of AI-generated scientific claims (based on experimental evidence in primary sources). The assignment reinforces student learning around responsible AI use for exploration while maintaining evidence- based skepticism. The assignment meets objectives around efficiently leveraging beneficial features of AI, distinguishing evidence types, and evidence-based claim evaluation. Its adaptable nature allows integration across diverse courses to teach students to responsibly use AI for learning while maintaining a critical stance. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Generative large language models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) often produce erroneous information unsupported by scientific evidence. This article outlines how these limitations may be leveraged to develop critical thinking and teach students the importance of evaluating claims based on experimental evidence. Additionally, the activity highlights positive aspects of generative AI to efficiently explore new topics of interest, while maintaining skepticism. © 2025 The Authors.

AU  - Campos, M.
T2  - European Public and Social Innovation Review
AB  - Introduction: The integration of AI in educational settings offers significant potential for enhancing learning experiences, particularly in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) contexts. AI tools, such as ChatGPT, provide personalized feedback on writing, addressing issues like unclear content, grammatical errors, or poor vocabulary. This study examines students' perceptions of AI-assisted feedback in a business CLIL course and evaluates the actual improvements in their writing based on the feedback provided by AI. Methodology: University students (n=205) participated in a 15-week Data Description writing course, using ChatGPT to receive specific criteria-based feedback on weekly compositions. Students revised their drafts based on this feedback before their submission. A survey (n=192) assessed their experiences and the perceived impact on writing skills and task efficiency. Additionally, a sample (n=336) of the writing compositions was coded and analyzed to evaluate linguistic enhancement. Results: Results indicate that students found AI feedback beneficial for improving writing skills and appreciated its immediacy and specificity. However, concerns were noted about the complexity and relevance of the feedback. Discussions: Despite these issues, students responded positively, showing significant improvement in content accuracy and linguistic proficiency. Conclusions: The study highlights the potential of AI tools and the need for refining AI feedback mechanisms. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems). All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring international students' perceptions of adopting generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies in learning
AU  - Cho, C.
AU  - Ofosu-Anim, D.
T2  - Social Sciences and Humanities Open
AB  - This study explores international students' perceptions of GenAI technologies in higher education, focusing on how gender and age influence their willingness to adopt. A survey of 122 international graduate students from a private university in South Korea showed that the students are generally familiar with GenAI and its uses in learning. However, its usage varied in frequency. The study also finds that male students are more likely to use GenAI than female students. Additionally, the study revealed age-related differences in the willingness of international students to adopt GenAI, with younger students showing more interest and willingness than older students. However, despite the differences in interest levels in adopting GenAI among genders and ages, the study revealed that overall, there is a general willingness among international students to learn and apply GenAI technologies to their studies. The South Korean education system can be reformed to accommodate the emerging and growing relevance of GenAI in education by developing ethical capacities that will enhance learning while addressing students’ concerns. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Interest has recently increased in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Although the publicly available GenAI tools are not specifically trained in the medical domain, they have demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of medical assessments. The future integration of GenAI in medicine remains unknown. However, the rapid availability of GenAI with a chat interface and the potential risks and benefits are the focus of great interest. As with any significant medical advancement or change, medical schools must adapt their curricula to equip students with the skills necessary to become successful physicians. Furthermore, medical schools must ensure that faculty members have the skills to harness these new opportunities to increase their effectiveness as educators. How medical schools currently fulfill their responsibilities is unclear. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) in the United States currently train a significant proportion of the total number of medical students. These COMs are in academic settings ranging from large public research universities to small private institutions. Therefore, studying COMs will offer a representative sample of the current GenAI integration in medical education. Objective: This study aims to describe the policies and training regarding the specific aspect of GenAI in US COMs, targeting students, faculty, and administrators. Methods: Web-based surveys were sent to deans and Student Government Association (SGA) presidents of the main campuses of fully accredited US COMs. The dean survey included questions regarding current and planned policies and training related to GenAI for students, faculty, and administrators. The SGA president survey included only those questions related to current student policies and training. Results: Responses were received from 81% (26/32) of COMs surveyed. This included 47% (15/32) of the deans and 50% (16/32) of the SGA presidents (with 5 COMs represented by both the deans and the SGA presidents). Most COMs did not have a policy on the student use of GenAI, as reported by the dean (14/15, 93%) and the SGA president (14/16, 88%). Of the COMs with no policy, 79% (11/14) had no formal plans for policy development. Only 1 COM had training for students, which focused entirely on the ethics of using GenAI. Most COMs had no formal plans to provide mandatory (11/14, 79%) or elective (11/15, 73%) training. No COM had GenAI policies for faculty or administrators. Eighty percent had no formal plans for policy development. Furthermore, 33.3% (5/15) of COMs had faculty or administrator GenAI training. Except for examination question development, there was no training to increase faculty or administrator capabilities and efficiency or to decrease their workload. Conclusions: The survey revealed that most COMs lack GenAI policies and training for students, faculty, and administrators. The few institutions with policies or training were extremely limited in scope. Most institutions without current training or policies had no formal plans for development. The lack of current policies and training initiatives suggests inadequate preparedness for integrating GenAI into the medical school environment, therefore, relegating the responsibility for ethical guidance and training to the individual COM member. © Tsunagu Ichikawa, Elizabeth Olsen, Arathi Vinod, Noah Glenn, Karim Hanna, Gregg C Lund, Stacey Pierce-Talsma.

AB  - A tremendous amount of technology (e.g., online learning platforms, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and robots) has been utilized to create rich interactive activities to upgrade preservice teachers’ knowledge and skills. However, there is a challenge to transform teacher preparation programs into a fully realized technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) application environment. Teachers’ technology leadership (TTL) should be considered to empower preservice teachers to apply TPACK. Since there was no empirical evidence concerning the impact of technology leadership on student outcomes, this study investigated the relationship between TTL and postgraduate preservice teachers’ application of TPACK by collecting quantitative data in Chinese normal university. Factor analyses were first conducted; and results indicated that the questionnaire combined the ISTE-E standards and TPACK framework was a reliable and valid survey instrument. The descriptive statistics results showed that TTL (professional growth and leadership, digital citizenship, technology collaboration, and technology-empowered learning) was highly perceived, and postgraduate preservice teachers’ TPACK components were at medium levels. Structural equation modeling test results revealed that TTL positively and significantly influenced all dimensions of postgraduate preservice teachers’ TPACK. Finally, limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are provided along with theoretical and practical implications. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-enhanced tools have entered all sectors of social life, including teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classes. Even though AI in education has been investigated by many researchers, the current state of AI use in Uzbekistan’s higher education remains under-researched. For this reason, the main goal of this article is to determine lecturers’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in Foreign Language Teaching (FLT) classes and explore the challenges that arose during the process. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining qualitative and quantitative data from semi-structured interviews conducted among seven university EFL teachers. The interview data were processed using thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes. In terms of validation, the research followed multiple stages, including careful participant selection based on experience with ChatGPT, cross-verification of transcripts, and coding to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings. The study’s findings revealed that teachers’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in EFL teaching were mainly positive, emphasizing its benefits such as providing students with real-time feedback, improving their autonomous learning skills, and features for checking grammar and spelling. However, participants also reported concerns such as over-reliance on AI assistance, a lack of students’ ethical knowledge in using AI in learning, and the negative influence of ChatGPT on students’ critical thinking skills. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge by offering insights into how lecturers perceive ChatGPT in higher education. This paper also highlights the main implications and limitations of the research. © 2025 by the authors.

T2  - Data Technologies and Applications
AB  - Purpose: This study explores the career trajectories of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) to uncover unique characteristics that contribute to their success. By utilizing web scraping and machine learning techniques, over two thousand CEO profiles from LinkedIn are analyzed to understand patterns in their career paths. This study offers an alternative approach compared to the predominantly qualitative research methods employed in previous research. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a framework for analyzing CEO career patterns. Job titles and company information are encoded using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) scheme. The study employs the Needleman-Wunsch optimal matching algorithm and an agglomerative approach to construct distance matrices and cluster CEO career paths. Findings: This study gathered data on the career transition processes of graduates from several renowned public and private universities in the United States via LinkedIn. Employing machine learning techniques, the analysis revealed diverse career trajectories. The findings offer career guidance for individuals from various academic backgrounds aspiring to become CEOs. Research limitations/implications: The building of a career sequence that takes into account the number of years requires integers. Numbers that are not integers have been rounded up to facilitate the optimal matching process but this approach prevents a perfectly accurate representation of time worked. Practical implications: This study makes an original contribution to the field of career pattern analysis by disclosing the distinct career path groups of CEOs using the rich LinkedIn online dataset. Note that our CEO profiles are not restricted in any industry or specific career paths followed to becoming CEOs. In light of the fact that individuals who hold CEO positions are usually perceived by society as successful, we are interested in finding the characteristics behind their success and whether either the title held or the company they remain at show patterns in making them who they are today. Originality/value: As a matter of fact, nearly all CEOs had previous experience working for a non-Fortune organization before joining a Fortune company. Of those who have worked for Fortune firms, the number of CEOs with experience in Fortune 500 forms exceeded those with experience in Fortune 1,000 firms. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction
AB  - Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to enhance the educational experience, its use also presents challenges. This research examines the use and misuse of AI tools for university-related tasks. We surveyed 498 students from three faculties at a large European university to, first, identify factors driving their willingness to use AI tools for university-related tasks, and, second, estimate the prevalence of cheating behavior involving the unauthorized use of AI tools in examinations. Specifically, we tested and extended the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) by identifying trust and perceived opportunity costs as additional determinants of using AI tools for university-related tasks. To estimate the proportion of students cheating during examinations, we applied a randomized response technique. We discuss the results with respect to the effective and appropriate implementation of AI tools in higher education. Our findings can help educators and policymakers to promote responsible AI use while mitigating its misuse. © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Antecedents of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technology Adoption: Extended Innovation of Diffusion Model with Cultural Dimensions and Risks Perceptions
AU  - Alamri, J.M.
T2  - Journal of Ecohumanism
AB  - As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are taking the lead among the technological advancements around the world, societies are increasingly becoming interwoven with Generative AI (GAI) technologies in all aspects, including higher education (HE). This study’s main aim is to examine how individual-level cultural dimensions influence students’ adoption of GAI in learning, drawing on an extended Innovation of Diffusion Theory (IDT) model. It explores the impact of individual-level cultural dimensions (individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance), IDT innovation factors (relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, observability, trialability), and individual factors (self-efficacy, perceived risk) on Saudi students’ perceptions of GAI adoption across several universities. Quantitative data were collected from 306 online survey and analyzed using CB-SEM. Results highlight the instrumental role of cultural dimensions, with individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance negatively affecting GAI adoption. While complexity showed no significant impact, all other IDT variables positively influenced adoption. Furthermore, self-efficacy and perceived risk were found to be significant indicators of GAI use. The study emphasizes the cultural differences that shape technology adoption in collectivist societies that are moving toward individualism such as Saudi. It identifies limitations, provides useful insights, and suggests recommendations for future research on GAI uptake in culturally diverse HE contexts. © 2025, J. Ecohum. All rights reserved.

T2  - Journal of Siberian Federal University - Humanities and Social Sciences
AB  - The article considers the role of information technologies in educational activities, their influence on the formation of professional competences of future teachers. The analysis of scientific publications and empirical research determined that the use of digital tools significantly improves the quality of training, promotes the creation of interactive materials and expands opportunities for independent learning. Special attention is paid to the introduction of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence and automated systems, which opens new avenues for the educational process. The state programme “Digital Kazakhstan” (2018-2024) focuses on the development of human potential in educational sphere, which is manifested through the introduction of modern curricula in universities, including areas such as artificial intelligence, data analysis and cloud technologies. This makes it possible to train professionals in demand on the labour market. The increasing number of grants for IT education inspires young people to choose promising specialities, while the development of online platforms makes high quality education accessible even to those living in remote parts of the country. Digital technologies are becoming an integral part of the educational process: the use of digital libraries, interactive whiteboards and virtual laboratories makes learning more exciting and effective. To create equal opportunities, the Internet infrastructure is being actively developed, providing schools with access to the network and introducing distance education platforms, which is especially important in the context of pandemics and other constraints. Digitalisation of the management of educational institutions simplifies interaction between students, parents and teachers: electronic diaries, journals and progress monitoring systems make the process more transparent and manageable (State Programme “Digital Kazakhstan”). Positive changes of the IT use in the training of future teachers have been identified, but there remain challenges related to insufficient training and infrastructural limitations. Based on the findings, recommendations for further development of digital technologies in teacher training are proposed, which will improve its quality and compliance with modern requirements. © Siberian Federal University.

AB  - Smartphone addiction (SA) has become a pervasive issue among university students. Therefore, it is important to better understand the conditions under which SA develops. Previous studies indicate that fear of missing out (FoMO), a psychological barrier to behavioural self-regulation, is often associated with SA risk. In the pedagogical context, poor self-regulation may manifest as lack of self-regulated learning skills (SRLSs), which may, in turn, be associated with the adoption of a superficial approach to learning tasks. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine and model the associations between deep and surface learning approaches, SRLSs, SA and FoMO among university students. The sample comprised 687 university students, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the data. The results indicated that SLRSs were positively associated with deep learning, and negatively associated with surface learning. It was also shown that higher SRLSs were associated with lower risk of FoMO and SA. However, while SRLSs may help reduce the level of SA among surface learners by helping them overcome FoMO, the same may not be said for students with a deep learning approach, whose reduced risk of SA due to higher SRLSs was not explained through FoMO. Based on the findings, interventions that aim to improve SRLSs appear warranted, as these may help reduce SA. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Fear of missing out (FoMO) is commonly associated with smartphone addiction (SA) risk. Smartphone notifications disrupt the learning activities of surface learners and FoMO may be the reason. FoMO is considered to be a challenge for behavioural self-regulation. What this paper adds Higher levels of self-regulated learning skills (SRLSs) are associated with deeper approaches to learning. Although a deeper approach to learning is associated with lower SA risk, a reduction in FoMO is irrelevant in explaining this effect. As far as surface learners are concerned, better SRLSs are associated with FoMO but are not associated with lower SA risk. Implications for practice and/or policy For deep learners, interventions that support the development of SRLSs are advised because these are important not only for fostering a deep approach to learning but also for helping reduce the risk of SA. Further research is necessary to identify the underlying mechanism by which improved SRLSs are associated with lower SA risk among deep learners. Further research is necessary to identify factors other than FoMO that may be associated with SA risk among surface learners. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is increasingly implemented in higher education, offering customized interventions and timely feedback to enhance learning experiences. While these tools have the potential to improve educational outcomes, they also introduce ethical risks and sociotechnical implications such as reduced learner autonomy. Current ethical discussions often focus on computational issues and overlook the nuanced impacts from students’ perspectives, which may increase students’ vulnerability. Taking a student-centered approach, we apply the Story Completion Method to investigate students’ concerns about adopting analytics-based AI tools in education. Seventy-one participants responded to the story prompts, which we analyzed qualitatively to uncover perceptions about how these tools may reshape pedagogical aspects such as learner autonomy, learning environments and approaches, interactions and relationships, and pedagogical roles. Our findings reveal that these potential impacts not only occur in isolation but also interact with one another. This study makes two primary contributions: first, it marks a novel application of the speculative design method to explore students’ perceptions of AIEd tools. Second, it provides a qualitative analysis of key themes derived from student responses, offering design implications for AIEd systems that are sensitive to student concerns and ethical considerations. These insights offer a foundation for future research and contribute to a more student-centered approach to the ethical development of AIEd. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2024.

AB  - Proofreading and editing are essential to enhance the quality of texts. While literature is abundant on technological tools for identifying semantic and lexical-grammatical errors, evidence on the actual effectiveness of artificial intelligence (ai) in this process remains limited, with studies varying in scope and rigor. This study examines whether existing evidence supports or contradicts the hypothesis that a ai-based applications help edit and proofread texts in higher education. A review was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering scientific articles in English and Spanish, published between 2019 and 2024, related to university writing and the use of ai in text correction. Most studies were exploratory and descriptive. A notable increase in publications related to ai and academic writing was observed between 2022 and 2024, with the United States, China, Australia, and Canada leading in this area. Findings suggest that ai improves linguistic quality and feedback in the writing process. It also highlights issues related to academic integrity, data privacy, and ai’s inability to manage complex writing errors. More explicit connections between ai and university instruction are necessary to complement traditional pedagogical strategies. The need for more research in this area is urgent, as issues related to equitable access and responsible integration are essential to the use ai to support academic writing development. © (2025), (Universidad de Antioquia).

AU  - Sabbaghan, S.
AU  - Eaton, S.E.
T2  - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
AB  - This qualitative study explores graduate students’ perceptions of using a generative AI-powered research application, COREI, and its impact on their sense of intellectual and scholarly ethics. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with graduate students (n = 10), four doctoral and six masters’, from a large research university in Western Canada. Participants were given access to COREI for one month and encouraged to use its features in their research projects. Thematic analysis of the interview data revealed four main themes: (1) academic integrity and generative AI collaboration, (2) agency in the generative AI-assisted research process, (3) authorship and the personalization of AI-generated content, and (4) originality through generative AI-assisted research. Although some participants initially expressed concerns about the potential for AI to compromise academic integrity, many came to view COREI as a collaborative tool that, when used responsibly, could enhance their research without infringing upon their scholarly ethics. Participants emphasized the importance of human agency and decision-making in the AI-assisted research process, and the need for critical evaluation and personalization of AI-generated content to maintain authorship. Originality emerged as a collaborative feat between human expertise and AI’s generative capabilities. The findings suggest a need for reconceptualizing traditional notions of agency, authorship, and originality in the context of AI-assisted research. The study highlights the importance of developing ethical frameworks and institutional policies that prioritize human agency and critical engagement with AI-generated content, while also emphasizing the need for further research on the long-term impacts of generative AI on intellectual and scholarly ethics. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Depression, characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest in daily activities, greatly reduces quality of life. Early detection is vital for effective treatment and intervention. While many studies use wearable devices to classify depression based on physical activity, these often rely on intrusive methods. Additionally, most depression classification studies involve large participant groups and use single-stage classifiers without explainability. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of classifying depression using nonintrusive Wi-Fi–based motion sensor data using a novel machine learning model on a limited number of participants. We also conduct an explainability analysis to interpret the model’s predictions and identify key features associated with depression classification. Methods: In this study, we recruited adults aged 65 years and older through web-based and in-person methods, supported by a McGill University health care facility directory. Participants provided consent, and we collected 6 months of activity and sleep data via nonintrusive Wi-Fi–based sensors, along with Edmonton Frailty Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale data. For depression classification, we proposed a HOPE (Home-Based Older Adults’ Depression Prediction) machine learning model with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification stages, evaluating various model combinations using accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. Shapely addictive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations were used to explain the model’s predictions. Results: A total of 6 participants were enrolled in this study; however, 2 participants withdrew later due to internet connectivity issues. Among the 4 remaining participants, 3 participants were classified as not having depression, while 1 participant was identified as having depression. The most accurate classification model, which combined sequential forward selection for feature selection, principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and a decision tree for classification, achieved an accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 90%, and precision of 88.3%, effectively distinguishing individuals with and those without depression. The explainability analysis revealed that the most influential features in depression classification, in order of importance, were “average sleep duration,” “total number of sleep interruptions,” “percentage of nights with sleep interruptions,” “average duration of sleep interruptions,” and “Edmonton Frailty Scale.” Conclusions: The findings from this preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility of using Wi-Fi–based motion sensors for depression classification and highlight the effectiveness of our proposed HOPE machine learning model, even with a small sample size. These results suggest the potential for further research with a larger cohort for more comprehensive validation. Additionally, the nonintrusive data collection method and model architecture proposed in this study offer promising applications in remote health monitoring, particularly for older adults who may face challenges in using wearable devices. Furthermore, the importance of sleep patterns identified in our explainability analysis aligns with findings from previous research, emphasizing the need for more in-depth studies on the role of sleep in mental health, as suggested in the explainable machine learning study. © Shayan Nejadshamsi, Vania Karami, Negar Ghourchian, Narges Armanfard, Howard Bergman, Roland Grad, Machelle Wilchesky, Vladimir Khanassov, Isabelle Vedel, Samira Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi.

AB  - The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students’ behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students’ BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER. These findings can help university students better accept and ethically use generative AI products. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Complex educational challenges emerge during Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) dissertation research, yet many newly hired faculty receive little preparation for the role of dissertation supervisor. The intensity and rigor of dissertation supervision are not reflected in workload calculations based on enrollments or clock hours. New faculty have few venues beyond personal experience to learn the challenges that supervision entails. Method: This article presents reflections of two research methodologists who supervise students in a nursing science PhD program in a large research university. It explores several challenges and dilemmas that characterize the supervision process. Results: Challenges of supervision involve dynamics of power, authority, and reputational self-protection, which reflect the paradoxical nature of the dissertation process, the distinct structure of graduate nursing education, nonlinear trajectories of doctoral learning, and risks related to the growth of generative artificial intelligence. Conclusion: Newly hired faculty need to be prepared for the unique challenges of supervising student research. © 2025 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

AB  - The perceived ease of use around artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT has created an ostensible moral and technological panic around how AI technologies are transforming higher education. This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model to suggest ‘perceived ease of use’ is both a factor in acceptance and panic around emerging technologies. We provide a qualitative analysis of statements, guides, and policies about AI and ChatGPT from 148 U.S. universities to argue that there is not so much a panic happening in higher education as there is a concerted effort to negotiate and integrate artificial intelligence into classroom, research, and daily operations. Across four different categories of statements – university policies, teaching and learning resources, library guides, and professor statements – we find recurring values emphasizing usefulness as well as navigating ethical concerns. ChatGPT’s perceived ease of use has led higher education faculty and staff to avoid panic discourses and focus on problem-solving discourses as they negotiate its institutionalization. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - Academic misconduct is a prevalent issue in higher education with detrimental effects on the individual students, rigor of the program, and strength of the workplace. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated concern over academic integrity and the potential use and misuse of AI. However, there is a lack of research on academic integrity in doctoral dissertations. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to explore academic misconduct in dissertations, specifically investigating the prevalence of AI use and plagiarism. Considering debate over the accuracy of technology in detecting AI-generated text, dissertations were also analyzed from before widespread AI availability, as a point of comparison. A sample of 200 dissertations from 2013 and 2023 were analyzed through Turnitin to flag plagiarism and AI-generated text. Results did not support any significant differences in plagiarism. However, 6% of analyzed dissertations from 2023 were positive for AI-generated text (AI scores over 20%). This is significantly different from 2013 dissertations, which only had 0% or < 20% AI scores. The findings of this study suggest that some students may be relying on generative text or editing from AI in their dissertations. Dissertation committees and awarding institutions have an obligation to ensure the students’ educational and ethical development and promote academic integrity at every level of education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to provide personalized instruction for students and elevate administrative tasks for teachers. AI-driven tools can improve accessibility for students learning English as a second language (L2) or foreign language helping educators consider their use in teaching. This research study explores AI-enabled technology usage, challenges, and opportunities in the Arab World. Study data is gathered from semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face, qualitative interviews with English language instructors at the University of Ha’il, KSA and Ajman University, UAE. Theoretically supported by sociocultural theory, results provided strong insights into AI technology in teaching. Results revealed that key challenges included plagiarism and the impact on students’ skills development, highlighting concerns about academic integrity and overreliance on AI tools like ChatGPT. Despite AI's potential to improve learning experiences by offering personalized support, participants emphasize the need for balanced integration and ethical use. Effective implementation needs comprehensive training for educators and maintaining a balance between AI tools and traditional teaching approaches to preserve critical thinking and creativity while using AI’s advantages. Thus, considering the findings, this study concludes that AI should supplement traditional teaching methods, ensuring that it enhances rather than replaces the crucial human aspects of education. Finally, study recommendations and implications are discussed accordingly. © 2025 Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of AI tools in education is reshaping how students view and interact with their learning experiences. As AI usage continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to understand how students' perceptions of AI technology impact their academic performance and learning behaviours. To investigate these effects, we conducted a correlational study with a sample of 44 students to examine the relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT’s utility—focusing on usage frequency, perceived usefulness, accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency—and key academic outcomes, including content mastery, confidence in knowledge, and grade improvement. Additionally, we explored how these perceptions influence student behaviours, such as reliance on ChatGPT, procrastination tendencies, and the potential risk of plagiarism. The canonical correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT's utility and their academic outcomes. Students who viewed ChatGPT as reliable and efficient tended to report higher grades, improved understanding of the material, and greater confidence in their knowledge. Furthermore, the bivariate correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between dependency on ChatGPT and procrastination (r = 0.546, p < .001), indicating that a higher reliance on AI tools may contribute to increased procrastination. No statistically significant association was identified between ChatGPT dependency and the risk of plagiarism. Future research should prioritize the development of strategies that promote the effective use of AI while minimizing the risk of over-reliance. Such efforts can enhance academic integrity and support independent learning. Educators play a critical role in this process by guiding students to balance the advantages of AI with the cultivation of critical thinking skills and adherence to ethical academic practices. © 2025 The Author(s).

T2  - Aslib Journal of Information Management
AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between virtual companionship (VCF) and privacy disclosure (PD) behavior in human-chatbot interactions. It aims to understand how the frequency of chatbot use, perceived value (PV), and perceived risk (PR) influence users’ willingness to disclose personal information. The research extends the privacy calculus theory into AI-based VCF contexts, providing insights into how users balance risks and benefits when interacting with chatbots. Design/methodology/approach: A 3-wave longitudinal study was conducted from May 2023 to May 2024, involving 657 university students. The study employed structural equation modeling to explore the relationships between the frequency of VCF, PV, PR and PD. The mediating effects of PV and PR were also tested to offer a comprehensive view of the privacy calculus in AI-chatbot interactions. Findings: The results show a significant positive correlation between the frequency of VCF and PD. PV positively mediated this relationship, suggesting that users disclose more information when they perceive higher benefits from the interaction. Conversely, PR negatively mediated the relationship, indicating that lower perceived risks lead to greater PD. Overall, frequent chatbot interactions increase PD, with users perceiving greater value that offsets potential privacy concerns. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to apply privacy calculus theory to the context of VCF with artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. It highlights the unique dynamics of PD in AI-driven interactions, offering valuable insights for chatbot developers to enhance user trust and manage privacy risks. The findings provide a framework for understanding how users balance risks and benefits when forming emotional connections with AI, which is crucial for future AI design and privacy policy development. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction
AB  - Artificial intelligence generates vibrant characters, encompassing teachers, peer students, and advisors within diverse educational media. However, the impact of the perceived embodiment of such characters in language learning videos on students’ technology acceptance and adoption is unclear. Integrating structural equation modeling into thematic analysis, this study analyzes 1042 valid responses from higher education students to bridge this research gap. Our study reveals that four subdimensions of embodiment (human-likeness, credibility, learning facilitation, and engagement) significantly and positively predict higher-education students’ perceived ease of use and usefulness of artificial intelligence-generated virtual teachers in language learning videos. Notably, an exception arises, as human-likeness does not significantly predict students’ perceived ease of use in our research context. Students’ perceived systemic interactivity and impact on the learning process emerge as pivotal mediators. The qualitative thematic analysis identifies students’ concerns about classroom administration, developmental support, technical issues, deprived interpersonal collaboration, and liberal attainment cultivation with the virtual teacher presence. This study can illuminate artificial intelligence technology designs and applications in education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background/purpose. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into child education presents transformative opportunities, yet Indonesian parental readiness remains insufficiently explored. This study examines parental preparedness, barriers to adoption, and policy interventions to ensure effective AI implementation in child education. Materials/methods. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving surveys of 100 Indonesian parents to assess AI literacy, accessibility, and attitudinal challenges. In-depth interviews provided qualitative insights into socio-economic constraints and cultural apprehensions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression modeling, while thematic analysis was applied to qualitative responses. Results. Survey findings revealed that while most parents recognized AI’s potential, their ability to support AI-integrated learning effectively remained limited. Higher education levels, digital literacy, and stable internet access were strong predictors of AI adoption readiness. However, substantial challenges persisted, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias apprehensions, and anxieties over reduced human interaction in learning. The practical implication of this study suggests that targeted AI literacy programs are key to empowering Indonesian parents for effective AI integration in child education. Conclusion. Parental readiness for AI integration in Indonesian child education remains critically limited, shaped by inadequate digital competencies, socio-economic constraints, and ethical apprehensions. This study proposes a policy agenda centered on AI literacy programs tailored to parents, accessible educational resources, equitable infrastructure, and data protection frameworks to enable responsible and inclusive AI adoption. As the first empirical mapping of Indonesian parental readiness in this domain, the study offers a globally relevant insight that underscores the urgent need to empower parents as co-navigators of AI-driven educational futures. © The Author(s).

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence models into academic settings has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Given that researchers' interactions with and perceptions of these technologies can substantially influence academic procedures and outputs, identifying the key determinants of their incorporation into university environments is crucial. This investigation pursued two main objectives: first, to identify the variables that condition the implementation of AI models in research activities, and second, to analyze how perceived ethical considerations and academic integrity influence their adoption. The empirical study was conducted through a digital survey administered to 302 academic researchers from Peruvian public and private universities. The analytical methodology employed structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, grounded in an expanded version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model. The results demonstrated that six out of nine hypotheses were supported; social influence, educational self-efficacy, and academic integrity were identified as primary factors predicting researchers' use of AI models. Effort expectancy had a significant negative effect on AI model use. Furthermore, the use of AI models was found to significantly influence both teachers' concerns and perceived ethics among academics. Notably, performance expectancy, technological self-efficacy, and personal anxiety did not significantly affect AI model use. This study contributes to the understanding of AI adoption in academic research by highlighting the importance of social, educational, and ethical factors. These findings have implications for developing policies and training programs to promote responsible AI use in higher education and suggest a need to reevaluate traditional technology acceptance models in the context of AI in academia. © 2025 The Authors

AU  - Cake, S.
T2  - Media Practice and Education
AB  - In early 2023, as the release of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT became more widespread, concerns arose in the higher education sector regarding how students might use generative AI (gen-AI), not only for writing critical essays, but for producing creative works. Multiple gen-AI tools appeared specifically targeting the application to writing screenplays. This prompted the question: what are the ethical and pedagogical implications of integrating gen-AI within the context of teaching and learning screenwriting within the academy? The research design for this project applied a practice-based approach to script development, embedding critical reflection on the iterative process of engaging with gen-AI to write a short screenplay. The gen-AI was also prompted to self-critique the story it generated. The research identified ethical concerns regarding equitable access to technology, the potential for bias and theft of works used to train the AI. The study also found that engaging with gen-AI privileged analytical thinking over emotional engagement with the creative process. The findings suggest that creative confidence and an awareness of one’s own creative process are critical to effectively engage with gen-AI. © 2025 The Author(s).

TI  - The impact of generative AI on academic integrity of authentic assessments within a higher education context
AU  - Kofinas, A.K.

T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - Generative AI (hereinafter GenAI) technology, such as ChatGPT, is already influencing the higher education sector. In this work, we focused on the impact of GenAI on the academic integrity of assessments within higher education institutions, as GenAI can be used to circumvent assessment approaches within the sector, compromising their quality. The purpose of our research was threefold: first, to determine the extent to which the use of GenAI can be detected via the marking and moderation process; second, to understand whether the presence of GenAI affects the marking process; and finally, to establish whether authentic assessments can safeguard academic integrity. We used a series of experiments in the context of two UK-based universities to examine these issues. Our findings indicate that markers, in general, are not able to distinguish assessments that have had GenAI input from assessments that did not, even though the presence of GenAI affects the way markers approach the marking process. Our findings also suggest that the level of authenticity in an assessment has no impact on the ability to safeguard against or detect GenAI usage in assessment creation. In conclusion, we suggest that current approaches to assessments in higher education are susceptible to GenAI manipulation and that the higher education sector cannot rely on authentic assessments alone to control the impact of GenAI on academic integrity. Thus, we recommend giving more critical attention to assessment design and placing more emphasis on assessments that rely on social experiential learning and are performative rather than output-based and asynchronously written. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic GenAI has enabled students to complete higher education assessments quickly and with good quality, leading to challenges in academic integrity. GenAI has transformed the requirements and considerations in assessment design in higher education. Authentic assessments are seen as a prominent way to tackle the GenAI challenge. What this paper adds We provide quantitative and qualitative experimental evidence suggesting that GenAI can generate authentic assessments that pass the scrutiny of experienced academics. We demonstrate how the use of authentic assessments alone does not protect the academic integrity of students in higher education. Our qualitative analysis indicates that markers may generate false positive and false negative results if they suspect GenAI tampering in an assessment. Thus, students' learning is not assessed correctly. Implications for practice and/or policy When universities and national organisations design policies regarding GenAI, authentic assessments are not the panacea; the focus must remain on assessment design. Assessments of learning need to shift from assessing output to focusing on process and relevance to the workplace. That would mean a paradigmatic shift from written assessments to synchronous interpersonal assessments. The move away from written assessments has implications that are far reaching for the academy if written assessments cannot be trusted as a reliable indicator for and of learning. © 2025 The Author(s).

TI  - A lightweight CNN-based ensemble approach for early detecting Parkinson’s disease with enhanced features
AU  - Saha, D.K.
AU  - Nath, T.D.
T2  - International Journal of Speech Technology
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) presents a neurological challenge affecting individuals with and without motor skills, particularly manifesting as speech difficulties during its initial phases. The successful diagnosis of PD often relies on the detection of these speech problems. Numerous initiatives are still being implemented to solve these problems and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD. However, several computational techniques have been effective in identifying PD in its early stages, bypassing the drawbacks of conventional diagnostic techniques. This study proposed an ensemble approach that combines machine learning (ML) and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to detect Parkinson’s disease (PD) in its early stages. For our investigation, we used the well-known PD dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository. The proposed ensemble approach is developed using two base methods: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a hybrid model called ParkRLP. To create the new dataset, the ParkRLP and MLP networks are level-0 learners, while the lightweight PD-CNN model is a level-1 learner. Successful PD detection is achieved by the proposed ensemble strategy using the level-1 classifier as the PD-CNN model. The lightweight PD-CNN model consists of eight layers. The conv-1D, Maxpooling-1D, and Dense layers have been used to modify the PD-CNN model. According to the dependent and independent factors in the newly generated dataset, the meta-classifiers were utilized for training. Then, the classifiers’ outputs are determined after they have been trained and tested at level-0. The efficacy of the proposed model was further underscored by its consistent 5% improvement over previous research on individual ML and CNN models. In conclusion, out of all the techniques for detecting PD, the proposed ensemble method of the lightweight CNN approach had the highest accuracy, at 99.47%, and an F1-score of 99.50%. Experimental findings demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed methodology in estimating PD and its simplicity for implementation in medical settings for diagnostic purposes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AU  - Haq, M.Z.U.
AU  - Cao, G.
AU  - Abukhait, R.M.Y.
T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - The release of ChatGPT has sparked an immense academic debate regarding its potential advantages and drawbacks for students. Despite its significance, there is a lack of empirical research on students' attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the utilization of ChatGPT. To fill this gap, we employed the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) and used partial least squares structural equation modelling to test the research model by collecting data from 287 university students in the UAE. Our key findings indicate that factors such as performance expectancy and effort expectancy positively influence students' attitudes towards ChatGPT. Additionally, personal development concerns demonstrate a negative association with attitudes and intentions to use ChatGPT, while perceived threat demonstrates a non-significant negative association with both. The findings of this research contribute to the emerging body of literature on ChatGPT's usage both conceptually and empirically. It also offers practical insights for future technology developers, emphasizing the significance of adopting a balanced approach that carefully considers both the benefits and potential drawbacks linked to the utilization of ChatGPT. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in natural language processing and has gained immense popularity since its launch, with rapid acceptance and adoption across various sectors. In higher education, ChatGPT has seen substantial use among university students and teachers. Previous studies have predominantly focused on investigating the attitudes and behavioural intentions of managers in organizational contexts and academic staff towards technology use in universities. What this paper adds This study addresses an empirical gap by focusing on students' behavioural intentions towards employing ChatGPT, offering a student-centric perspective. It draws upon established technology acceptance literature and employs the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) to explore factors shaping students' attitudes and intentions regarding ChatGPT utilization. By adopting a “net valence approach”, the study considers both positive and negative factors associated with ChatGPT use in higher education. The findings provide valuable insights for educators, students, and policymakers by presenting a balanced and holistic understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing students' attitudes and behavioural intentions. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators can leverage the findings to better understand students' perspectives and design educational strategies that effectively integrate ChatGPT into learning processes. Students can utilize the insights to make informed decisions about incorporating ChatGPT into their academic activities. Policymakers can consider the implications of ChatGPT adoption in higher education and develop guidelines and regulations to ensure its responsible and ethical use. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.

TI  - Using Generative AI to Enhance Experiential Learning: An Exploratory Study of ChatGPT Use by University Students
AU  - Sun, R.
AU  - “Nancy” Deng, X.
T2  - Journal of Information Systems Education
AB  - This paper examines university students’ perceptions of and experiences with using ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tool, to enhance their experiential learning. In this exploratory study, we designed a ChatGPT learning activity flow corresponding to the four experiential learning steps. Analysis of survey data collected from 70 students in a business college at a public university in the United States revealed that, under the guidance of the instructors, students learned to interact with ChatGPT through two prompts. Quantitative analysis suggested that the knowledge type and the associated cognitive process of student-created prompts depended on those of the prompt provided by their instructor, controlled by students’ prior ChatGPT experience. In addition, qualitative data analysis revealed that students considered the GenAI tool helpful with their learning tasks and were satisfied with the content generated by ChatGPT. However, some students raised concerns about ChatGPT output involving metacognitive knowledge. Three themes emerged regardless of students’ prior ChatGPT experience, but some subtle differences were observed. Our findings extend the literature on experiential learning and Bloom’s taxonomy in the context of adopting GenAI in higher education. The study also contributes to Information Systems education by revealing challenges, offering suggestions, and proposing principles for GenAI-assisted learning. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research and policy making. © (2025), (ISCAP- Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals). All rights reserved.

AU  - Trujillo, F.
AU  - Pozo, M.
AU  - Suntaxi, G.
T2  - Journal of Technology and Science Education
AB  - This paper presents a systematic literature review of using Machine Learning (ML) techniques in higher education career recommendation. Despite the growing interest in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for personalized academic guidance, no previous reviews have synthesized the diverse methodologies in this field. Following the Kitchenham methodology, we analyzed 38 studies selected from an initial pool of 1,296 articles, retrieved using a custom-built web scraper leveraging the CrossRef API. Data were extracted based on ML techniques, data types, and validation metrics. Our findings reveal that Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks are the most frequently employed models to improve the accuracy and personalization of career recommendations in higher education. These systems typically use academic performance, personal interests, and demographic data as the primary data types. The review also highlights key validation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, which reflect the effectiveness of these models. However, limitations were identified, such as the lack of access to open datasets and the scarcity of studies with longitudinal data that evaluate the long-term impact of recommendations. Additionally, ethical considerations, particularly regarding fairness, transparency, and data privacy, were highlighted as critical challenges. This systematic literature review provides a solid foundation for improving career recommendation systems using advanced ML techniques. By integrating ML with traditional counseling approaches, this research underscores the potential to revolutionize academic guidance and better align students with their career goals. © Article’s contents are provided on an Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 Creative commons International License.

TI  - Exploring EFL Learners’ Perceptions on the Use of AI-Powered Conversational Tools to Improve Speaking Fluency: A Case Study at Majmaah University
AU  - Mudawy, A.M.A.
T2  - Forum for Linguistic Studies
AB  - It is widely known that technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), presents innovative opportunities for improving English language learning skills. However, little is known about the effect of AI-mediated activities on learners’ speaking skills. This study, therefore, aims to explore the EFL learners’ attitudes and perceptions of the use of AI-powered conversational tools to improve speaking fluency. Forty EFL learners at Majmaah University were randomly assigned to respond to a structured questionnaire to collect quantitative data, followed by an individual semi-structured interview in the qualitative phase. Thematic analysis was employed for qualitative data, while descriptive and inferential statistics through SSPS were used for quantitative data. The findings of the study indicate that EFL learners at Majmaah University have a positive attitude and perceptions toward using AI-powered conversational tools to enhance and promote their speaking fluency. Moreover, EFL learners at Majmaah University agreed that AI-powered conversational tools improved their speaking fluency, and they felt that their pronunciation was enhanced after using these tools. Additionally, the learners reported significant limitations and challenges, including technical difficulties, such as pronunciation recognition and cultural misinterpretations. In addition, most of the EFL learners in the interviews reported that the lack of personalized feedback was a crucial challenge. The study provides valuable insights for language educators and researchers regarding technology-mediated instruction in language classrooms. Copyright © 2025 by the author(s).

AB  - Recent studies have conceptualized ChatGPT as an epistemic authority; however, no research has yet examined how epistemic beliefs and metacognitive accuracy affect students' actual use of ChatGPT-generated content, which often contains factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the present experimental study aimed to examine how university students integrate correct and incorrect information from expert-written and ChatGPT-generated articles when writing independently (N = 49) or with ChatGPT assistance (N = 49). Students working with ChatGPT-4o integrated more correct information from both expert-written (d = 0.64) and ChatGPT-generated articles (d = 0.95), but ChatGPT-assisted writing did not affect the amount of incorrect information sourced from the ChatGPT-generated article. Regardless of the condition, hierarchical regressions revealed that lower metacognitive bias was moderately associated with increased inclusion of correct information from the expert-written article (R2 = 12%). Conversely, a higher metacognitive bias (R2 = 10%) and epistemic beliefs (R2 = 12%) were moderately related to the inclusion of incorrect information from ChatGPT-generated articles. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT assistance enhances the integration of correct human- and AI-generated content, metacognitive skills remain essential to mitigate the risks of incorporating incorrect AI-generated information. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly regarded as epistemic authorities due to their authoritative tone and human-like interaction. ChatGPT has demonstrated utility in providing correct information and improving productivity in educational and professional contexts, but it is also prone to inaccuracies, hallucinations and misleading content. Students' epistemic beliefs and metacognitive skills predict their ability to critically evaluate and integrate conflicting information from multiple resources, particularly when searching for information on the Internet. What this paper adds This study experimentally examines how students integrate correct and incorrect information from expert-written and ChatGPT-generated articles when writing independently or with ChatGPT's assistance. The findings show that ChatGPT assistance improves the inclusion of correct information but does not significantly reduce or increase the inclusion of incorrect ChatGPT-generated content. Metacognitive accuracy and epistemic beliefs are key factors in mitigating the inclusion of incorrect information, regardless of whether students work independently or with ChatGPT. Implications for practice and/or policy Generative AI tools can outperform human experts in specific scenarios, requiring little to no evaluation. However, in situations where these tools generate misleading or incorrect content, the application of metacognitive skills and epistemic beliefs becomes essential to discern reliable information and avoid the integration of errors. Educational interventions should include activities requiring justification of knowledge, evaluation of resources and reflection upon human-generated and AI-generated texts to enhance students' ability to discern accurate from inaccurate information. Interventions focused on metacognitive accuracy and epistemic awareness can empower individuals to critically evaluate and differentiate between reliable and erroneous information, enhancing their recognition of misinformation. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.

T2  - Information Research
AB  - Introduction. Generative AI presents opportunities and challenges for higher education, particularly concerning equity. Understanding stakeholders' perceptions of equity is crucial as AI increasingly influences teaching, learning, and administrative practices. Method. The study was conducted in a large, research-intensive institution in the US. Participants (n=206) from diverse university roles responded to an open-ended question about how Generative AI affects educational equity. The responses were analyzed based on the information and equity dimensions (Lievrouw & Farb, 2003). Analysis. Data were analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive coding to identify key themes. The framework of information inequity underscores how disparities in access, skills, and ethical considerations create uneven opportunities for stakeholders to benefit from Generative AI, making these dimensions essential for understanding educational equity. Results. Findings revealed differing focal points among the groups: faculty and staff concentrated on issues of physical and financial access to AI tools, while students placed greater emphasis on the ethical implications and value-based considerations of AI in education. Conclusion. The study suggests that addressing AI equity in higher education requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond improving access. AI literacy education should include skills development and address ethical considerations, ensuring that all stakeholders' concerns are met. © 2025, University of Boras. All rights reserved.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, presents new challenges impacting student perceptions of academic integrity. While extensive research exists on academic misconduct and student perceptions of various infractions, there is limited understanding of how AI tools impact these views and whether their use constitutes a violation of academic integrity policies. This study explores university students’ awareness and perceptions of academic misconduct, particularly concerning AI tool usage. A survey of domestic and international students enrolled at major universities in the United States received 277 valid responses. The results reveal high awareness of university integrity policies and significant concern about the use of AI for writing papers, with substantial variance in perceptions of misconduct severity. Notably, using AI to write entire papers is seen as major misconduct by a majority, while smaller AI-assisted tasks are viewed as less severe. Regression analysis highlights the importance of ethical education, revealing that students who view AI writing as cheating and those who believe cheating is unethical perceive academic misconduct more seriously. Conversely, student demographics (major, educational level, gender, international status), awareness of AI detection tools, and perceived ethics of AI use show complex, often non-significant relationships with perceptions of misconduct severity. These findings provide indication that education and clear policy about AI usage and academic misconduct could be useful in addressing a growing number of infractions in the face of emerging AI trends. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence brings opportunities and unique challenges to nontraditional higher education students, stemming, in part, from the experience of the digital divide. Providing access and practice is critical to bridge this divide and equip students with needed digital competencies. This mixed-methods study investigated how nontraditional higher education students interact with ChatGPT in multiple courses and examined relationships between ChatGPT interactions, engagement, self-efficacy and performance. Data were collected from 73 undergraduate and graduate students through chat logs, course reflections and artefacts, surveys and interviews. ChatGPT interactions were analysed using four metrics: prompt number, depth of knowledge (DoK), prompt relevance and originality. Results showed that ChatGPT prompt numbers (β = 0.256, p < 0.03) and engagement (β = 0.267, p < 0.05) significantly predicted performance, while self-efficacy did not. Students' DoK (r = 0.40, p < 0.01) and prompt relevance (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) were positively correlated with performance. Text mining analysis identified distinct interaction patterns, with ‘strategic inquirers’ demonstrating significantly higher performance than ‘exploratory inquirers’ through more sophisticated follow-up questioning. Qualitative findings revealed that while most students were first-time ChatGPT users who initially showed resistance, they developed growing acceptance. Still, students tended to use ChatGPT sparingly and, even then, as only a starting point for assignments. The study highlights the need for targeted guidance in prompt engineering and AI literacy training to help nontraditional higher education students leverage ChatGPT more effectively for higher-order thinking tasks. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Nontraditional students face unique challenges in higher education, such as limited technological literacy and digital access. The emergence of generative AI tools presents both opportunities and challenges for addressing educational disparities. Existing studies on AI implementation predominantly focus on traditional students. What this paper adds Empirical evidence of how nontraditional students interact with ChatGPT through multiple metrics (prompt number, DoK, relevance and originality). Distinct interaction patterns and their relationship to performance outcomes. The relationship among ChatGPT interactions, engagement, self-efficacy and performance. Implications for practice and/or policy Need for explicit instruction in prompt engineering as a critical skill for higher-order thinking.

AB  - The rapid expansion of generative artificial intelligence tools for textual production, such as ChatGPT, has been accompanied by a proliferation of similar tools used for creating images, audiovisual content, and motion graphics. These tools, valued for their creativity, are increasingly employed in the fields of art, education, and entertainment to enhance content creation, particularly on social media, while also reducing production costs. However, their use is not without controversy, as they raise significant ethical concerns, including the potential for generating fake news and disinformation. This paper presents an analysis of higher education students’ perspectives on the use of generative artificial intelligence tools within the context of a university course. The research was conducted through semi-structured interviews with 10 fourth-year students from the Department of Communication and Digital Media at the University of Western Macedonia. The study aims to provide an initial understanding of the impact of these tools in both education and communication, focusing on students who are future professionals in the communication field. The interviews explored the potential benefits of these technologies, which were valued highly, and the challenges presented such as privacy and credibility issues, which concerned the participants. Misinformation and deception were cited as the most significant risks, while these tools were evaluated positively in terms of communicative purposes, but still maintaining skepticism. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - E-Learning and Digital Media
AB  - This study examines the distinguishing markers between AI-generated and human-created texts within university education, specifically in the context of student assignments. Using a multimodal qualitative approach, we analysed selected Bachelor’s and Master’s theses, identifying recurring characteristics of AI-generated content. Key markers include among others: fragmented argumentation flow, specific use of language, formulaic structures, and excessive objectivity, which contrast with the more nuanced and cohesive style typical of human writing. The research also includes survey responses from students across two universities (Europe & Asia), revealing varied attitudes towards AI use in academic work. While some students view AI as a beneficial tool for text enhancement, others express ethical concerns regarding its impact on authorship and originality. The findings suggest that both students and educators must adapt to the growing presence of generative AI in academia, balancing its use with critical thinking and ethical guidelines. This research provides a foundation for developing AI literacy and detection methods, highlighting the need for systematic strategies to integrate AI responsibly within educational frameworks, thus supporting academic integrity and fostering digital literacy. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - This qualitative study explores lecturers’ perspectives on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in personalised learning within higher education. The rapid proliferation of AI has introduced numerous ethical challenges, including the potential for academic dishonesty and misuse. One concern highlighted in this study is maintaining academic integrity while fostering responsible and ethical AI use in educational contexts. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, the research examines how lecturers navigate these complexities through innovative teaching and assessment strategies. Data were collected from 16 lecturers via open-ended questionnaires, and thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke’s six-step framework, was employed to identify recurring themes. The study is limited in its reliance on self-reported data, which may not fully capture the nuances of lecturers’ experiences or practices. Additionally, the study is context-specific, focusing on a limited sample size, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader contexts. Findings reveal that lecturers employ strategies such as using AI-detection tools like Turnitin to uphold academic integrity, redesigning assessments to include in-class components, and encouraging transparency by having students declare AI use. Another significant finding is the emphasis on fostering critical thinking skills to enable students to engage ethically with AI tools. The study recommends that higher education institutions train lecturers and students on ethical AI use, promote transparency in AI-assisted academic work, and invest in technologies that support these objectives. Revising assessment strategies to incorporate innovative, controlled formats is also suggested to mitigate misuse, ensuring the responsible integration of AI into educational practices. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - The emergence of ChatGPT, a Generative AI program, has sparked discussions about its teaching and learning value, and concerns about academic integrity in higher education (HE). An extant review of the literature indicates that a scarcity of research exists on GenAI, specifically a synthesis of the official views, guidelines and articles of top-ranked universities on the use, limitations, challenges, and opportunities brought by ChatGPT in the early phase when ChatGPT was released in 2022 until early May 2023, which can offer insights into the concerns and recommendations for educators. Using the corpus assisted discourse analysis approach, this study identified the key themes and emotions elicited by evaluations of the ChatGPT situation from a self-built corpus containing 151 articles from 47 top-ranked U.S. universities and 34 U.K. ones. Our findings indicated three prominent themes discussed on official websites, including ChatGPT as a text and content generator, use of ChatGPT in teaching and learning, and potential implications and opportunities of using ChatGPT in HE. Further examination revealed that bias, concern, worry, threat, fear, and trust were the prevailing emotions relating to ChatGPT. Illustrated with examples collected from our corpus, this paper offers an in-depth discussion of universities’ first responses to the use of ChatGPT. The insights gained have some pedagogical implications for academics, researchers and educators and may inform policy and practice in HE on the use of GenAI. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: This paper aims to explore the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in academic libraries in Croatia and its potential impact on library services. It seeks to present the challenges and opportunities in AI implementation and the factors that may influence its adoption. Methodology: To research the application of AI in academic libraries, a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques, was employed. Specifically, an online survey consisting of 21 open-and closed-ended questions was conducted. The survey targeted academic libraries in Croatia to gather comprehensive data on the current state of AI implementation. Results: The research showed a low response rate to the survey, with only 22%, as AI implementation in Croatian academic libraries is still in its early stages. The results revealed that barriers such as a lack of funding, expertise, and institutional support hinder wider adoption, along with concerns about AI’s impact on critical thinking and human roles. The lack of training and strategic planning around AI oversight may have contributed to the low response rate, complicating the drawing of firm conclusions. However, the survey did indicate the potential for AI use in the surveyed higher education libraries, as they recognise its possible benefits in work processes and user experiences. Originality: This study is among the first to explore the current state and future implications of AI adoption in academic libraries in Croatia. It provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of AI implementation and its potential impact on library services in the country. © 2024, National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

AB  - This paper investigates the transformative impact of video learning and artificial intelligence (AI) on enhancing the learning experience in mechanical engineering education. Through a quantitative and qualitative study using a survey, 145 undergraduate mechanical engineering students at the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Portugal, provided insights into their utilization and perceptions of video learning and AI-based tools. The results showed a widespread acceptance and utilization of video resources as supplementary learning aids, particularly for reinforcing understanding of complex concepts in engineering subjects. Moreover, students recognize AI's potential to revolutionize traditional education systems. Unlike traditional video learning, AI offers innovative solutions to enhance interactive learning experiences for students. However, while video learning is often employed for comprehending complex subjects, AI-based tools, despite their interactive nature, are currently considered more advantageous for addressing less intricate topics. Challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the integration of AI in education are also addressed. The study underscores the need for educators to strike a balance between technological innovation and traditional pedagogical approaches to ensure that AI and video learning enrich rather than replace the learning experience. Ultimately, by increasing the strengths of AI and video learning, educators can cultivate engaged, empowered, and proficient mechanical engineering graduates prepared to navigate the complexities of the modern technological landscape. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into higher education, particularly through Academic Performance Prediction (APP), promises enhanced educational outcomes. However, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding data privacy, potential biases, and broader socio-technical implications. Our study, focusing on Germany–a pivotal player in shaping the European Union's AI policies–seeks to understand prevailing perceptions of APP among students and the general public. Initial findings of a large standardized online survey suggest a divergence in perceptions: While students, in comparison to the general population, do not attribute a higher risk to APP in a general risk assessment, they do perceive higher societal and, in particular, individual damages from APP. Factors influencing these damage perceptions include trust in AI and personal experiences with discrimination. Students further emphasize the importance of preserving their autonomy by placing high value on self-determined data sharing and explaining their individual APP. Recognizing these varied perceptions is crucial for educators, policy-makers, and higher education institutions as they navigate the intricate ethical landscape of AI in education. This understanding can inform strategies that accommodate both the potential benefits and concerns associated with AI-driven educational tools. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - This study investigates how U.S. college students (N = 1001) perceive and use ChatGPT, exploring its relationship with societal structures and student characteristics. Regression results show that gender, age, major, institution type, and institutional policy significantly influenced ChatGPT use for general, writing, and programming tasks. Students in their 30s–40s were more likely to use ChatGPT frequently than younger students. Non-native English speakers were more likely than native speakers to use ChatGPT frequently for writing, suggesting its potential as a support tool for language learners. Institutional policies allowing ChatGPT use predicted higher use of ChatGPT. Thematic analysis and natural language processing of open-ended responses revealed varied attitudes towards ChatGPT, with some fearing institutional punishment for using ChatGPT and others confident in their appropriate use of ChatGPT. Computer science majors expressed concerns about job displacement due to the advent of generative AI. Higher-income students generally viewed ChatGPT more positively than their lower-income counterparts. Our research underscores how technology can both empower and marginalize within educational settings; we advocate for equitable integration of AI in academic environments for diverse students. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Applied Corpus Linguistics
AB  - The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) poses new challenges for L2 writing teachers. This study investigates the distinguishability of essays written by Japanese EFL learners from those generated by ChatGPT. Partially replicating Herbold et al. (2023), 140 first-year university students wrote essays and completed a survey on ChatGPT use. Among them, 125 wrote independently, 13 used ChatGPT for proofreading, and two asked ChatGPT to write the entire essay. To create a comparative dataset, 123 additional essays were generated by ChatGPT, imitating the two texts. The resulting 263 essays were then analyzed using the natural language processing (NLP) technique, including automated linguistic analysis and machine learning classification using random forest. The results reveal significant differences between human-written and ChatGPT-generated essays across all linguistic features, with the latter being easily identifiable. This study emphasizes the need for clear guidelines on the ethical use of AI in L2 writing, highlighting the potential risk of inappropriate AI use and the importance of fostering a mutual understanding of AI use with learners regarding responsible AI integration in academic work. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The emergence of artificial intelligence, exemplified by generative chatbots such as ChatGPT, has elicited optimism among some educators regarding enhanced teaching and learning methods. Simultaneously, it has raised concerns among others, who perceive these chatbots as being disruptive to established pedagogical norms developed over centuries. This study investigated pre-service teachers’ perceptions regarding integrating ChatGPT into physical sciences teaching at a rural South African university. A case study research design utilizing a qualitative approach was adopted to collect, analyze, and interpret data. This methodology was employed to gain comprehensive insight into the viewpoints held by final year Bachelor of Education Honors physical sciences students serving as pre-service teachers. The study explored the benefits and potential challenges of incorporating emerging technologies such as ChatGPT into physical sciences teaching. The theoretical framework guiding the study was the technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. Eleven purposively sampled physical sciences pre-service teachers participated in semi-structured interviews. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The research findings indicate that ChatGPT has the potential to contribute to the teaching of physical sciences in the areas of lesson planning, preparation, presentation, and formative assessment. However, the study revealed that ChatGPT is unable to answer certain questions in the physical sciences accurately and this was of great concern. These findings shed light on how artificial intelligence generative chatbots can be incorporated into physical sciences learning. The findings provide insights for policymakers, who can facilitate the use of these tools in lesson preparation; science educators, who should leverage the chatbots to enhance learner engagement; and researchers, to help them deepen their understanding of the role of emerging technologies in science education. ©Authors.

AB  - Higher education is crucial for the development of states and societies and improving the overall quality of life. However, entry into higher education is often influenced by factors beyond qualifications, and individuals in the field face suppression from the controlling parties. These challenges undermine the value of education and the integrity of democratic processes like elections. In this paper, we study academic freedom in Lebanon and propose a technique that dynamically extracts the factors that might affect academic freedom. This technique comprises multiple stages: data collection, data preprocessing, static extraction of factors, dynamic extraction of factors, and evaluation. In the data collection stage, data was obtained from 254 participants through a questionnaire that discusses various facets of academic freedom. The preprocessing stage enhances data quality through cleaning, normalizing, and transforming. For static extraction, factors impacting academic freedom are identified using naive K-means clustering. In dynamic extraction, the Apriori algorithm identifies key metrics. Finally, a customized K-means algorithm clusters data based on a specific metric. This algorithm was applied on both, the statically and dynamically extracted metrics, and comparison was done based on the accuracy of the resultant clustering. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique in identifying and analyzing factors impacting academic freedom. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Journal of Second Language Writing
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has revolutionised the landscape of academic writing, presenting both advantages and risks to learning for L2 writers. It is thus imperative that L2 writers, especially at advanced academic levels, develop the critical skills necessary for employing GAI tools ethically and effectively in their writing processes. Our study addressed this need by 1) conceptualising Critical GAI Literacy based on current research and our collected data, and 2) developing a self-regulated learning-based micro-curriculum for L2 doctoral students to cultivate knowledge and skills using GAI for academic writing. We collected interactive and reflective data in an introductory-level academic writing course at a Swedish university enrolled with 60 PhD students from diverse backgrounds and examined their evolving perspectives and strategies for engaging in GAI-mediated writing. Findings show a spectrum of initial attitudes among students and limited knowledge of GAI use. Final reflections illustrate de-enchantment with GAI, recalibrated and enhanced understanding of ethical issues, developed prompting methods, and increased awareness of text ownership through the self-directed learning process. Furthermore, students demonstrated a discerning approach in evaluating GAI-generated suggestions and sociolinguistic impacts, indicating a growing criticality in L2 writing practices. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Students pursuing different professional courses at the higher education level during 2021–2022 saw the first-time occurrence of a pandemic in the form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their mental health was affected. Many works are available in the literature to assess mental health severity. However, it is necessary to identify the affected students early for effective treatment. Design/methodology/approach: Predictive analytics, a part of machine learning (ML), helps with early identification based on mental health severity levels to aid clinical psychologists. As a case study, engineering and medical course students were comparatively analysed in this work as they have rich course content and a stricter evaluation process than other streams. The methodology includes an online survey that obtains demographic details, academic qualifications, family details, etc. and anxiety and depression questions using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The responses acquired through social media networks are analysed using ML algorithms – support vector machines (SVMs) (robust handling of health information) and J48 decision tree (DT) (interpretability/comprehensibility). Also, random forest is used to identify the predictors for anxiety and depression. Findings: The results show that the support vector classifier produces outperforming results with classification accuracy of 100%, 1.0 precision and 1.0 recall, followed by the J48 DT classifier with 96%. It was found that medical students are affected by anxiety and depression marginally more when compared with engineering students. Research limitations/implications: The entire work is dependent on the social media-displayed online questionnaire, and the participants were not met in person. This indicates that the response rate could not be evaluated appropriately. Due to the medical restrictions imposed by COVID-19, which remain in effect in 2022, this is the only method found to collect primary data from college students. Additionally, students self-selected themselves to participate in this survey, which raises the possibility of selection bias. Practical implications: The responses acquired through social media networks are analysed using ML algorithms. This will be a big support for understanding the mental issues of the students due to COVID-19 and can taking appropriate actions to rectify them. This will improve the quality of the learning process in higher education in Oman. Social implications: Furthermore, this study aims to provide recommendations for mental health screening as a regular practice in educational institutions to identify undetected students. Originality/value: Comparing the mental health issues of two professional course students is the novelty of this work. This is needed because both studies require practical learning, long hours of work, etc. © 2023, Reshmy Krishnan, Shantha Kumari, Ali Al Badi, Shermina Jeba and Menila James.

AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students' inevitable use of AI chatbots. This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Four artificial intelligence (AI) image generators (Adobe Firefly, DALL·E2, Craiyon, and DreamStudio) were utilized to produce “faces” of chemists with varying occupational titles. Images were analyzed for representational biases and compared to data available from National Science Foundation (NSF). Presentational biases were analyzed within American Chemical Society (ACS) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Respect guidelines with a particular focus on presentation of diversity and disability. Amplification of both representational and presentational biases was observed for all four AI generators despite alignment of demographic trends with NSF and ACS reporting. Influences of occupationally tied prompts (specific to chemistry) on demographic distributions of AI-generated images were investigated. At least one AI image generator assigned women and racial minorities to “assistant” positions while males and whites occupied the “top” positions in the field. Our data also demonstrates erasure of people with visible disabilities in the AI-generated outputs. Perspectives of current students in chemistry classes at Winona State University on “what a chemist looks like” have been collected and analyzed. The disturbing prevalence of a “white male” image of a chemist, even for students identifying as female or a person of color, was evidenced. This research brings forward concerns about the utilization of “black box” algorithms for training generative AI for nonbiased image generation using consumer feedback when novices themselves perpetuate both representational and presentational biases prior to their exposure to AI’s perspectives, especially in chemistry where substantial NSF and ACS efforts have been forwarded to diversify and revitalize the next generation of scientists. © 2024 The Authors.

T2  - Profesional de la Informacion
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has much significance in different industries, including education. Due to increasing technological advancement, universities show their growing concerns about adopting several facilities linked with AI, specifically in their library management systems. Motivated by such an emerging trend, this research was conducted to examine AI adoption in both public and private libraries in China. The study explored the existing landscape of AI-powered services in libraries, the perception of AI benefits, challenges related to AI adoption, and key determinants of such adoption for the targeted libraries. Using a questionnaire technique, the study collected data from different public and private libraries for which a sample of 154 respondents was finalized over the time span of 4.5 weeks. The analysis of the collected data shows that both the situations of launching and planning to launch different AI-related services were observed in Chinese libraries. Moreover, participants also confirmed several benefits of AI, including the enhancement of library operations by improving search accuracy, automating repetitive tasks, offering personalized resource recommendations, revealing usage trends through analytics, curating digital collections, improving cataloging, digitizing rare materials, and providing quick responses via chatbots, thereby allowing librarians to conduct their other more complex tasks. Additionally, the study confirmed several challenges associated with AI adoption. The results also revealed that along with other factors, the support from university administration, maturity and reliability of AI applications, and training and human resource management are positive and significant determinants of AI adoption. On the contrary, funding/cost associated with implementation and innovative services/alignment with technological trends reflected negative coefficients for AI adoption in Chinese libraries. © 2024, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - Purpose: The advent of artificial intelligence technologies, exemplified by platforms such as ChatGPT, has created a profound global impact, with a particular resonance in education. This research aims to integrate the information systems success (ISS) model with the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) paradigm to explore how information quality and service quality individually, jointly, congruently, and incongruently affect higher education students’ trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention. Design/methodology/approach: We employed a sophisticated methodology - polynomial regression with response surface analysis - and conducted our study with a sample of 468 higher education students selected in Vietnam using a three-phase stratified random sampling approach to evaluate the hypotheses developed. Findings: The findings indicate that both information and service quality influence higher education students’ trust directly and positively in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention. Moreover, a balance between information quality and service quality can increase students’ level of trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and intention to continue using it. Nevertheless, a significant incongruity between information quality and service quality will likely reduce trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and the intention to continue using the service. Originality/value: This research is one of the first to offer a shred of empirical evidence about how information quality and service quality interact congruently and incongruently with each other to trigger higher education students’ trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention of ChatGPT. It thus offers valuable insights for leveraging the benefits and mitigating potential challenges associated with adopting this innovative technology in educational settings. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Aims: To examine the understanding of the ethical dilemmas associated with Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) among Jordanian medical students, physicians in training, and senior practitioners. Methods: We implemented a literature-validated questionnaire to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the target population during the period between April and August 2023. Themes of ethical debate included privacy breaches, consent, ownership, augmented biases, epistemology, and accountability. Participants’ responses were showcased using descriptive statistics and compared between groups using t-test or ANOVA. Results: We included 466 participants. The greater majority of respondents were interns and residents (50.2%), followed by medical students (38.0%). Most participants were affiliated with university institutions (62.4%). In terms of privacy, participants acknowledged that Big Data and AI were susceptible to privacy breaches (39.3%); however, 59.0% found such breaches justifiable under certain conditions. For ethical debacles involving informed consent, 41.6% and 44.6% were aware that obtaining informed consent posed an ethical limitation in Big Data and AI applications and denounced the concept of “broad consent”, respectively. In terms of ownership, 49.6% acknowledged that data cannot be owned yet accepted that institutions could hold a quasi-control of such data (59.0%). Less than 50% of participants were aware of Big Data and AI’s abilities to augment or create new biases in healthcare. Furthermore, participants agreed that researchers, institutions, and legislative bodies were responsible for ensuring the ethical implementation of Big Data and AI. Finally, while demonstrating limited experience with using such technology, participants generally had positive views of the role of Big Data and AI in complementing healthcare. Conclusion: Jordanian medical students, physicians in training and senior practitioners have limited awareness of the ethical risks associated with Big Data and AI. Institutions are responsible for raising awareness, especially with the upsurge of such technology. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - AI chatbots have ignited discussions and controversies about their impact on teaching and learning practices in higher education. This study explores students' adoption and perceptions of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots in higher education. Based on survey data from a large sample (n = 5894) across Swedish universities, the study employs descriptive statistical methods to analyze usage, attitudes, and concerns, and inferential statistics to identify relations between attitudes and usage and background variables (gender, academic level, and field of study). The results reveal broad awareness and use of ChatGPT among students, but not of other AI chatbots. More than half of the students expressed positive attitudes towards the use of chatbots in education, but almost as many expressed concerns about future use. Statistically significant differences were found across all examined grouping variables, particularly between genders and fields of study. Female students and students from the humanities and medicine consistently expressed more negative attitudes and concerns about AI's role in learning and assessment, while males and technology and engineering students showed higher usage and optimism. These findings not only validate the continued relevance of student backgrounds as a determinant of technology adoption but also expose several challenges and considerations surrounding AI and chatbot usage in education. The study supports the development of local solutions to AI in education tailored to student attributes and needs, and it provides insights for developers, educators, and policymakers. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The widespread popularity of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots has sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly regarding their impact on academic integrity among students. While several studies have examined AI's role in education, a significant gap remains concerning how AI chatbot usage affects students’ perceptions of academic integrity. This study aims to address this gap through rigorous quantitative techniques to explore the dynamics of student interactions with AI chatbots and assess whether this engagement diminishes academic integrity in higher education. Using a non-experimental design, the research investigates the causal relationship between AI chatbot usage and academic integrity, focusing on eight latent variables identified in the literature. A stratified sampling technique was employed to collect a representative sample of 594 participants via a 5-point Likert scale survey from four Southern Asian countries. The dataset underwent extensive statistical analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. The findings establish significant links between motivations for using AI chatbots and a decline in academic integrity. The study identifies a behavioral link between academic integrity and pedagogical limitations, highlighting traditional classroom-based pedagogy as the most impactful factor influencing students’ motivation to engage with AI chatbots. This research not only quantitatively addresses ethical concerns related to AI in academia but also offers insights into user behavior by assigning distinct weights to post-usage behavioral factors, differentiating it from earlier studies that treated these factors equally. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The rapid adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT by students has the potential to disrupt the higher education sector, with concerns being raised by academics about potential threats to academic integrity. This paper contributes to the pressing discussion about responses to AI tools by examining students' perceptions and the use of generative AI to assist them with assessments. Based on a survey among 337 Australian university students, this study found that more than a third of students have used a chatbot for assistance with an assessment, and do not necessarily perceive this as a breach of academic integrity. The study further investigated to what extent different psychosocial factors such as learning motivations, distress or resilience are associated with students’ use of AI chatbots in order to ascertain environmental conditions or risk factors driving their use. Findings suggest that the higher education sector faces the challenge of not only defining clear policies and guidelines about ethical and academically honest ways to use and integrate generative AI tools into university education and assessments, but also to rethink the design of assessment pieces. © 2024

TI  - AI-based prediction of academic success: Support for many, disadvantage for some?
AU  - Herrmann, L.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The use of computational tools to predict academic success has become increasingly popular. Machine learning algorithms, trained on past study histories, have been shown to provide valid predictions. However, knowing about biases and unfairness in algorithms, one should take a closer look at these predictions. This paper explores the extent to which the predictive accuracy of academic success varies between specific groups of students, focusing on traditional and non-traditional students (NTS), who have not acquired a higher education entrance qualification at school. In a case study the study compares several popular algorithms and their prediction quality, and investigates whether misclassified NTS show positive or negative biases. Results revealed that the accuracy of predicting academic success for NTS was significantly lower than when considering all students as a whole. The direction of the distortion cannot be determined exactly due to small case numbers. The study emphasizes that the possibility of bias always has to be considered when predicting study success, and the use of such tools must ensure there are no undesirable biases that could affect certain students. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Researchers have observed the relationship between educational achievements and students' demographic characteristics in physical classroom-based learning. In the context of online education, recent studies were conducted to explore the leading factors of successful online courses. These studies also investigated how demographic features impact student achievement in the online learning environment. This motivates the use of demographic information alongside other features to predict students' academic performance. Since demographic features include protected attributes, such as gender and age, evaluating predictive models must go beyond minimizing the overall error. In this work, we analyze and investigate the use of neural networks to predict underperforming students in online courses. However, our goal is not only to enhance the accuracy but also to evaluate the fairness of the predictive models, a problem concerning the application of machine learning in education. This paper starts by analyzing the available solutions to fairness in predictive models: bias mitigation with pre-processing and in-processing methods. We show that the current evaluation is missing the case of partial awareness of protected features, which is the case when the model is aware of bias on some protected attributes but not all. The in-processing method, specifically the adversarial bias mitigation, shows that debiasing in some protected features exacerbates the bias on other protected features. This observation motivates our proposal of an alternative approach to enhance bias mitigation even in the partial awareness scenario by working with latent space. We implement the proposed solution using denoising autoencoders. The quantitative analysis used three distributions from The Open University Learning Analytics dataset (OULAD). The obtained results show that the latent space-based method offers the best solution as it maintains accuracy while mitigating the bias of the prediction models. These results indicate that in the case of partial awareness, the latent space method is considered superior to the adversarial bias mitigation approach. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - ChatGPT's impact on education is both significant and inevitable, presenting a paradox of threats and benefits. While studies have explored ChatGPT's usage, intention, and motivation, few have addressed its paradoxical use from a benefit-risk-coping perspective, leaving gaps in practical and theoretical solutions. This study integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to elucidate ChatGPT's paradoxical use in education. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it aims to provide insights and solutions for managing the benefits, risks, and coping mechanisms associated with ChatGPT in education. Hypotheses and propositions were tested on Taiwanese higher education users (N = 351). Findings from SEM confirm that the perceived threat of ChatGPT's severity decreases the intention to use it, while coping strategies such as self-efficacy and response efficacy strongly predict the intention to use ChatGPT. Additionally, the benefits of performance expectancy and task efficiency significantly increase the intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn significantly increases actual usage behavior. Findings from fsQCA reveal three configurations for both the usage and disusage of ChatGPT in education. The study identifies three constructs with necessary conditions. This research makes a significant theoretical contribution by integrating UTAUT and PMT into a unified framework to elucidate the paradoxical aspects of benefit-risk-coping in the use of ChatGPT. Practical implications for higher educational institutions and their scholars (e.g., students, lecturers, researchers) are also provided through confirmed solutions from the QCA model. These solutions offer strategic insights to leverage the benefits, identify the risks, and cope with the threats associated with using ChatGPT in education. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Metaverse—a three-dimensional computational environment—combines physical and virtual reality to enable social relationships and immersive experiences by mimicking real-world scenarios. Metaverse is considered the third wave of the internet revolution (exploiting Web 3.0), leveraging upcoming technologies such as extended reality and artificial intelligence shaping a new era of human–-machine interactions. In recent years, increased research and development on educational technologies (EduTech) based on blockchain technology has seen substantial growth of metaverse-based solutions within the higher education context. This research aims to synergize blockchain technology and metaverse environments to conduct online exams (metaExam) in a trustworthy, reliable, and secure way. The synergy between blockchain and the metaverse brings various benefits, such as improved security, cost effectiveness, and increased efficiency in the online examination process. One of the central features of the proposed solution metaExam is to leverage cryptographic protocols via blockchain to control data access, making verification faster and protecting against misuse. Exam scores and grades are stored on a blockchain ledger using a digital signature method to enhance security. We validated the proposed solution by testing a prototype on the Ethereum platform using the Sepolia Testnet network using Microsoft Windows environment. Evaluation results indicate (i) query response time (10–50 ms), (ii) and query execution performance (CPU utilization between 1%–5%) offering computationally feasible solution. This research contributes by integrating blockchain and metaverse technologies to offer a solution metaExam that can offer improved security and immersive user experience for exam management. The proposed solution and its validation can provide insights into transforming online exams, offering a fresh perspective on addressing concerns about exam grade authenticity and verifying academic credentials in EduTech. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, notably ChatGPT, are increasingly recognised for their transformative potential in higher education. This study employs a detailed case study approach complemented by a survey, delving into ChatGPT’s impact on pedagogical practices, student engagement, and academic performance. It involved 74 undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in data analytics courses in Australia. The quantitative analysis highlights ChatGPT’s role in providing personalised and on-demand support, which is highly valued among users for its flexibility and responsiveness, meeting a critical demand in educational settings. Notably, the study identifies a medium effect size (η2=0.173) in perceived benefits, indicating that ChatGPT accounts for approximately 17.3% of the variance in improved academic outcomes. However, challenges such as ChatGPT’s limited understanding of complex queries and the lack of human interactions are primary concerns, with a medium effect size (η2=0.289) suggesting significant areas for improvement. Furthermore, statistical analyses reveal a clear relationship between the frequency of ChatGPT usage and the perception of its benefits, underscoring the transformative potential for users who have integrated it into their academic practices. Despite these challenges, the differential impact on users versus non-users highlights the potential for ChatGPT to foster more engaging and effective educational practices. The findings advocate for targeted strategies to epitomise ChatGPT’s integration into educational settings, emphasising the need for ongoing research and the development of comprehensive guidelines to navigate its complexities and maximise its educational benefits. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Recent studies have recognized the potential and drawbacks of using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially ChatGPT, in education. However, studies exploring the possibility of GenAI tools in language education are scarce from the perspective of critical pedagogy. This qualitative study explores the perspectives of 14 academics in Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) regarding the use of GenAI in pedagogical contexts and how such use of these GenAI tools fosters an environment of inclusivity and equality among learners. Employing an open-ended survey questionnaire and follow-up individual interviews, the findings not only highlight the perceived benefits of GenAI in terms of boosting inclusion, participation, and confidence among students, as well as supporting tailored learning experiences and providing feedback in real-time but also its transformative potential, fostering educational fairness, and maximizing the learning experiences of all students. Teachers viewed the integration of GenAI positively, as it could enhance language education by providing students with personalized learning experiences, interactive simulations, and real-time feedback. We discuss the limitations and offer some recommendations. © 2024 The Author(s)

TI  - AI and ethics: Investigating the first policy responses of higher education institutions to the challenge of generative AI
AU  - Dabis, A.

T2  - Humanities and Social Sciences Communications
AB  - This article addresses the ethical challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in higher education and explores the first responses of universities to these challenges globally. Drawing on five key international documents from the UN, EU, and OECD, the study used content analysis to identify key ethical dimensions related to the use of generative AI in academia, such as accountability, human oversight, transparency, or inclusiveness. Empirical evidence was compiled from 30 leading universities ranked among the top 500 in the Shanghai Ranking list from May to July 2023, covering those institutions that already had publicly available responses to these dimensions in the form of policy documents or guidelines. The paper identifies the central ethical imperative that student assignments must reflect individual knowledge acquired during their education, with human individuals retaining moral and legal responsibility for AI-related wrongdoings. This top-down requirement aligns with a bottom-up approach, allowing instructors flexibility in determining how they utilize generative AI especially large language models in their own courses. Regarding human oversight, the typical response identified by the study involves a blend of preventive measures (e.g., course assessment modifications) and soft, dialogue-based sanctioning procedures. The challenge of transparency induced the good practice of clear communication of AI use in course syllabi in the first university responses examined by this study. © The Author(s) 2024.

AU  - Kohnke, L.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools (e.g. ChatGPT) has elicited mixed reactions among English language instructors and learners. This study explores how first-year students in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course at a Hong Kong university perceive GenAI and traditional grammar-checking tools (e.g. Grammarly, MS Word). We employed a qualitative methodology grounded in the interpretivist paradigm, conducting semi-structured interviews with 14 students. The findings revealed the students perceived GenAI tools to be more comprehensive and authoritative, as they provide detailed explanations and contextual insights that enhance language proficiency. However, they also noted concerns about overreliance, data privacy and equitable access to premium features.

AB  - This study aims to compare the responses of Islamic Universities in Indonesia and Thailand to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in Islamic education learning. This comparative qualitative research collected data from in-depth interviews, participatory observation, and analysis of relevant documents at UIN Walisongo Semarang (Indonesia) and Darul Maarif Islamic College Patani (Thailand). The collected data were analyzed thematically using triangulation, member checking, and audit trail validation models. The findings of this study show similarities and differences; both institutions have not specifically incorporated AI into the formal curriculum as a course, only integrating it implicitly in the hidden curriculum such as research, workshops, and seminars. Indonesian Islamic universities view AI as an important tool for modernizing Islamic education, especially in distance learning and the digitalization of Qur'anic teaching. In contrast, although AI is not explicitly banned in Thailand, there are concerns about its impact on the role of traditional teachers and Islamic cultural values. Regarding ethics, Indonesian students are less likely to consider the potential bias of AI towards Islamic religious information. In contrast, Thai students are more wary of the impact of technology on their religious values. Mastery of AI technology also showed significant differences, with Indonesian students being more advanced. © 2024, Institut Pesantren KH Abdul Chalim. All rights reserved.

AU  - Driessens, O.

T2  - MedieKultur
AB  - The sudden and meteoric rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) has raised fundamental concerns for universities. Using Bacchi’s methodology on ‘problematisation’, we analyse which concerns Danish universities have addressed through their policies and guidelines. We identify three key problematisations: assessment integrity, legality of data and veracity. While each of these problematisations involves specific limitations, together they also strongly emphasise symbolic and epistemological issues and consequently mostly ignore the materiality of genAI, for example, in terms of labour and energy use. Drawing on critical AI studies, this article argues that universities should also consider the huge planetary costs that (gen)AI poses as well as the full range of AI’s exploitative business models and practices. Universities should integrate these considerations into both their decision-making on (not) using certain technologies and their policies and guidelines for research and teaching, just as sustainability is already a criterion in their travel or investment policies today. © 2024 Society of Media Researchers In Denmark.

AB  - This article presents a bibliometric analysis of research on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in higher education over the past decade. Through computer-assisted analysis of 412 documents from the Web of Science core collection, we shed light on publication trends, productivity patterns, and conceptual development. Despite this exponential growth in research output, there remains significant uncertainty about the long-term impact of AI on pedagogical practices, learning outcomes, and the overall structure of higher education systems. The results show an annual production increase of 31.8% in research publications on AI in higher education, signaling scientific recognition of the disruptive potential. The concentration in renowned specialist journals on the topic of technology-supported learning is offset by the distribution of these journals across 206 multidisciplinary sources. With 10 publications, the Chinese University of Hong Kong is the leading contributing institution. China leads in the number of publications on AI in higher education, with 62 articles, followed by the United States with 45 and the United Kingdom with 29. These regional anchors are driving progress in the field. Although there is strong collaboration, the research output remains spread across 1,182 scientists without established leaders, reflecting the diverse and emerging nature of the field. Topic modeling and keyword analysis mean an increasing examination of the connections to education systems, training, labor markets, and learning analyses. This highlights the tensions surrounding data ethics, academic integrity, and the disruption of the workforce as algorithms permeate admissions, advising, and teaching. Our examination of the anatomy of this rapidly growing field provides indispensable perspectives for guiding innovation. As techniques advance from theory to reality, continued empirical research to explore risks and opportunities will be critical to upholding humanistic educational values. ©Authors.

AB  - The increasing use of AI-assisted writing tools in education presents new challenges in ensuring the integrity and originality of student essays. This study investigates English teachers’ perceptions of various essay assessment methods in light of these challenges. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative Likert-scale data and qualitative open-ended responses, the research reflects the perspectives of 50 experienced educators from the Faculty of Linguistics at the National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.” The study investigates teachers' familiarity with AI tools, the challenges they face in assessing AI-assisted student work, and their views on AI's role in aiding or potentially hindering student writing skills. Findings indicate that while many educators support AI for tasks like grammar and proofreading, concerns persist over its impact on students' critical thinking and originality. Assessment methods currently in use include in-class handwritten essays, oral defenses, AI-detection software, and portfolios. The results indicate that hybrid assessment methods are rated as the most effective for evaluating AI-influenced essays, indicating a preference for combining traditional and AI-specific techniques. Implications and recommendations for research and practice have been outlined, emphasizing a balanced approach that promotes ethical AI usage, critical thinking, and academic integrity in writing assessments. © 2024, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.

T2  - Social Sciences
AB  - In this paper, the effects of the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) in higher education (HE) are discussed. A mixed exploratory research approach was employed to understand these impacts, combining analysis of current research trends and students’ perceptions of the effects of Gen AI tools in academia. Through bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review, 64 publications (indexed in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases) were examined, highlighting Gen AI’s disruptive effect on the pedagogical aspects of HE. The impacts identified by the literature were compared with the perceptions held by computer science students of two different HE institutions (HEIs) on the topic. An exploratory study was developed based on the application of a questionnaire to a group of 112 students. The results suggest that while Gen AI can enhance academic work and learning feedback, it requires appropriate pedagogical support to foster critical, ethical, and digital literacy competencies. Students demonstrate awareness of both the risks and benefits associated with Gen AI in academic settings. The research concludes that failing to recognize and effectively use Gen AI in HE impedes educational progress and the adequate preparation of citizens and workers to think and act in an AI-mediated world. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Collegiate Aviation Review
AB  - Despite the potential opportunities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chatbots in higher education, ethical concerns surrounding their use, such as biased data assumptions and plagiarism, have been raised. Despite studies examining these concerns in higher education, there seems to be a gap in evaluating perceptions of constructs: ethical use, attitudes towards technology, behavioral factors, and student learning outcomes relating to Generative AI Chatbots in Collegiate Aviation Programs in the U.S. Using perceptions of aviation students from six universities in the U.S. (n=271), a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of the constructs fit the empirical data well; most hypothesized relationships were significantly supported. The most substantial direct relationship was between attitude towards AI Chatbot use and behavioral intention to use AI Chatbots. Despite deep concerns about the ethical use of AI Chatbots in collegiate aviation programs, the model could explain about 59% of the variances in user behavior, suggesting relatively good user behavior among respondents. Graduate respondents had higher user behavior than first—and second-year undergraduates, who had higher scores on ethical use concerns. Male respondents showed higher user behavior than female respondents. By understanding students’ perceptions, administrators can create well-informed policy guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective integration of AI Chatbot tools in collegiate aviation programs pedagogy. © 2024, University Aviation Association.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Sustainable consumption is crucial for mitigating global sustainability challenges. Understanding consumer behaviors and motivations, particularly in developing regions, is essential for designing effective interventions. This study pioneers an innovative methodology integrating participatory visual methods (photovoice) and artificial intelligence analysis to investigate food waste perceptions in an emerging economy context. Twenty-six university students participated in the study, documenting their lived experiences and perspectives on household food waste through photographs and narratives. The key results included 32% of participants expressing shock at the extent of food waste in their daily lives, while 28% showed relative indifference. AI-powered (Artificial Intelligence) computer vision and natural language processing were used to efficiently analyze the large visual and textual dataset. The mixed methods approach generated nuanced, situated insights into consumer attitudes, behaviors, and socio-cultural drivers of wastage. The key themes included low waste consciousness, aesthetic and convenience motivations, social norms, and infrastructural limitations. The participatory process proved effective for raising critical consciousness and uncovering consumption practice dynamics. AI analysis enabled rapid knowledge discovery from the qualitative data while mitigating researcher bias. This innovative integration of participatory methodologies and computational analytics advances sustainable consumption research by empowering marginalized voices and generating contextual insights from unstructured data. With further development, such human-centered AI approaches can transform the study and governance of sustainable consumption. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed chatbots into generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) capable of performing various tasks. The use of GPTs is expanding to learning, including natural sciences like chemistry. GPTs can assist students in understanding and solving chemistry problems. However, there are potential negative impacts of using GPTs. This study aims to explore Indonesian university students’ perspectives on using GPTs for chemistry learning. The research used a case study method and collected data through questionnaires, interviews, and GPT usage logs, which were then analyzed thematically. The study revealed that students use GPTs in learning due to perceived usefulness, ease of use, emotional aspects, benefits, and social influence. Students appreciate GPT answers for being easy to understand, detailed, reliable, fairly accurate, fast, and helpful. However, students also recognize that GPT answers can be unreliable, difficult to understand, not always accurate, and potentially unethical. Students evaluate GPT responses by stimulating thoughts, confirming answers, integrating with other sources, directly copying responses, and paraphrasing before use. They are also aware of ethical considerations, drawbacks, and limitations associated with using GPTs. Findings pertaining to motives, constraints, and the evaluation of answer quality and its utilization can serve as indicators for the proper application of GPT in educational contexts. In many countries, including Indonesia, where there is a lack of usage regulations, concrete policies are necessary to ensure the proper integration of GPT into education. © 2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - The research aims to assess the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of the teaching and learning of journalistic writing techniques in the university educational context. The main objective consists of analysing the abilities of AI to solve the composition of different journalistic texts¸ both informative and opinion, and the quality of the result, as well as other applications of AI in journalistic writing. The text tries to contribute to the knowledge on the use of AI by teachers and students in the teaching and learning process. A mixed methodology has been used to develop the research: on the one hand, descriptive and comparative, based on surveys to university professors in Spain specialised in this subject and to students taking related contents in their studies, also in this context; on the other hand, an experimental research is included among professors trained in the field of Journalistic Writing, who are asked for the qualified correction of an exam, anonymous, actually carried out with the AI system, ChatGPT. After weighing the results, each of them is interviewed in depth about the quality of the texts, their strengths, and weaknesses. The results show that AI is beginning to be used in the university context by students and professors. In the specific field of journalistic writing, its use for the moment is limited to assisting tasks in the writing process or suggesting topics, while the automatic generation of content is not widely accepted due to the ethical implications that it entails, especially those related to the originality of content. Teachers value the potential of this technology for writing simple and informative pieces but observe limitations at deeper levels of knowledge and in hybrid texts. © 2024 Communication & Society.

AB  - With Generative AI’s (GenAI) rapid development and the ability to generate sophisticated human-like text, it has evolved as a powerful technology in various domains. However, its application in the education domain was initially met with resistance due to concerns about disrupting traditional learning and assessment methods, raising questions about academic integrity, and provoking ethical dilemmas related to data privacy and bias. Many schools, higher educational institutions, and governments initially chose to ban the use of GenAI tools due to the disruptions they caused to learning and teaching practices, only to rescind their bans later. This study conducts a literature review to investigate GenAI tools from the perspectives of key stakeholders in the educational domain— students, educators, and administrators—highlighting their benefits while identifying challenges and limitations. The review found several benefits of using GenAI, such as personalised learning, immediate support, language support, and reduced administrative workload. This paper also provides usage guidelines for stakeholders and outlines future research areas to support GenAI adoption in higher education. Our findings indicate that most studies involving students had a positive view of using GenAI. There is a noticeable gap in research focusing on administrators, highlighting the need for further investigation. © 2024.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) advances and the rapid adoption of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, present new opportunities and challenges for higher education. While substantial literature discusses AI in higher education, there is a lack of a systems approach that captures a holistic view of the structure and dynamics of the AI transformation of higher education institutions (HEIs). To fill this gap, this article develops a causal loop diagram (CLD) to map the causal feedback mechanisms of AI transformation in a typical HEI. We identify important variables and their relationships and map multiple reinforcing and balancing feedback loops accounting for the forces that drive the AI transformation and its impact on value creation in a typical HEI. The model shows how, motivated by AI technology advances, the HEI can invest in AI to improve student learning, research, and administration while dealing with academic integrity problems and adapting to job market changes by emphasizing AI-complementary student skills. We explore model insights, scenarios, and policy interventions and recommend that HEI leaders become systems thinkers to manage the complexity of the AI transformation and benefit from the AI feedback loops while avoiding policy traps that may lead to decline. We also discuss the notion of HEIs influencing the direction of AI and directions for future research on AI transformation and the sustainability of HEIs. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study reports on a novel phenomenon observed in scholarly publications. Some research articles unrelated to the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content (AIGC) contain phrases such as 'As an AI language model...' The authors conceptualize this phenomenon as 'AIGC footprints.' To provide early evidence, they conducted a small-scale sample investigation by collecting twenty-five articles. These articles were published by authors from countries in Central Asia, South Asia, and Africa. Among these authors, there were assistant professors, doctoral and master's students. Single authors and single affiliations were more common. Analysis of the article content revealed that some authors utilized ChatGPT for literature reviews or idea generation. The twenty-five articles with AIGC footprints were published in eighteen different academic journals. The emergence of AIGC footprints reflects the potential challenges faced by scholarly publishing and higher education. The authors also provide several recommendations. © University of Toronto Press.

TI  - B-Wheel – Building AI competences in academic libraries
AU  - Kautonen, H.

T2  - Journal of Academic Librarianship
AB  - Academic libraries have moved swiftly to grasp the challenges and opportunities of the new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The body of academic and practice-based literature is growing fast, showing how libraries are exploring their role in Information Literacy (IL) and AI, ethics and AI, and how they vigorously test and adopt various AI-powered tools for their services. Across these accounts, librarians express concern about their competence, skills and knowledge of the new technology and its implications for the research community. In this article, we present a holistic process model called the B-Wheel that addresses the phenomenon's complexity with approaches adopted from design thinking ideologies. We propose design approaches as an alternative strategy for academic libraries that want to avoid partial optimisation of AI skills and to ensure more generative competency building in their organisation. We drew inspiration for the B-Wheel model from the principles and pedagogy of the 20th-century Bauhaus art and design school in Germany. The article focuses on the model's features and its elements, constructed through workshops in Scandinavian research libraries. We also present experiences from the first use case in a University Library in Scandinavia. We propose that the main principles of the B-Wheel process model – a holistic design approach and learning by doing – are transferable across and beyond academic libraries. © 2024

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Automated prediction of students' retention and graduation in education using advanced analytical methods such as artificial intelligence (AI), has recently attracted the attention of educators, both in theory and in practice. Whereas invaluable insights and theories for measuring and testing the topic have been proposed, most of the existing methods do not technically highlight the non-trivial factors behind the renowned challenges and attrition. To this effect, by making use of two categories of data collected in a higher education setting about students (i) retention (n = 52262) and (ii) graduation (n = 53639); this study proposes a machine learning model - RG-DMML (retention and graduation data mining and machine learning) and ensemble algorithm for prediction of students' retention and graduation status in education. This was done by training and testing key features that are technically deemed suitable for measuring the constructs (retention and graduation), such as (i) the Average grade of the previous high school, and (ii) the Entry/admission score. The proposed model (RG-DMML) is designed based on the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, implemented using supervised machine learning technique such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and validated using the k-fold cross-validation method. The results show that the executed model and algorithm based on the Bagging method and 10-fold cross-validation are efficient and effective for predicting the student's retention and graduation status, with Precision (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.822), Recall (retention = 1.000, graduation = 0.957), Accuracy (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.817), F1-Score (retention = 0.952, graduation = 0.885) showing significant high accuracy levels or performance rate, and low Error-rate (retention = 0.090, graduation = 0.182), respectively. In addition, by considering the individual features selected through the Wrapper method in predicting the outputs, the proposed model proved more effective for predicting the students' retention status in comparison to the graduation data. The implications of the models' output and factors that impact the effective prediction or identification of at-risk students, e.g., for timely intervention, counselling, decision-making, and sustainable educational practice are empirically discussed in the study. © 2024

T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - In our postdigital world, unseen algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) underpin most business and educational technologies and systems. Also, the use of educational data to better understand and support teaching and learning is growing in higher education. Other AI technologies such as synthetic media and AI-generated avatars are increasingly used to present video-based content in business and society but are less common in educational content and lectures, as their effectiveness and impact on learning are still being researched and debated. In this study, an AI-generated avatar was implemented in the redesign of business ethics material in a postgraduate course to present videos and online activities and to prompt critical reflection and discussion of the social and ethical implications of algorithms. Using a qualitative research design, we then explored students’ perceptions of teaching and learning with AI-generated avatars. The students interviewed felt AI avatars were suitable, sometimes even preferred, for lecture delivery, with some enhancements. This study contributes insights into the use of AI-generated avatars in education by examining their potential benefits and challenges and generating three key pedagogical principles to consider. Future directions for educational design and research are discussed, particularly the pressing need to engage students creatively and critically with the social and ethical implications of AI avatars. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of previous research on lifelong vocational education to generate generalized conclusions about its effects, set directions for future lifelong vocational education and identify implementation measures. Design/methodology/approach: To conduct a meta-analysis on research results that have a heterogeneous distribution, it is important to specify the analysis category for examining the effects of research variables. Findings: First, lifelong vocational education has an effect on dependent variables. And action appears to have the highest effect size on dependent variables. Next, when calculating the size of variables that had an effect on lifelong vocational education by educational type, the effect size of informal education was found to be larger than that of formal education. Finally, regarding the effect on the participants, office workers were influenced most, followed by university students, North Korean defectors, job seekers and foreigners. Research limitations/implications: Although this study attempted to conduct an in-depth analysis of subcomponents, it was not possible to analyze variables at a more detailed level. Therefore, future studies should aim to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of different variables based on a wider composition. Because lifelong vocational education is relevant to people’s daily lives, it should be investigated in the context of their personal characteristics and social backgrounds. Practical implications: This research was designed to uncover general effects of lifelong vocational education and discover relevant variables affecting lifelong vocational education in South Korea. A meta-analysis of 15 studies with 67 subgroups examining lifelong vocational education was conducted. Social implications: In the current era of VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity), lifelong vocational education needs to be organized systematically, unlike in the past. With the rapid advancements in technology influenced by artificial intelligence and the fourth industrial revolution, there is a surge in social demands for continued reeducation and redevelopment of employees to prepare for talent development paradigm innovation, increasing unemployment among unskilled workers and competence enhancement needs among job seekers and employed individuals. Originality/value: This study aims to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of previous research on lifelong vocational education to draw generalized conclusions on its effectiveness and discuss its implications for implementation measures. Specifically, this study will analyze the general effect size; differences in the effect size among different dependent variable groups; and the effect size based on lifelong vocational education participants. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Future research recommendations for transforming higher education with generative AI
AU  - Chiu, T.K.F.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Higher education is crucial for producing ethical citizens and professionals globally. The introduction of generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has posed opportunities and challenges to the traditional model of education. However, the current conversations primarily focus on policy development and assessment, with limited research on the future of higher education. GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic literature review to investigate the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51 students from three research-intensive universities was selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future higher education should be transformed to train students to be future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI. They suggest new learning outcomes—skills in learning and teaching with GenAI, AI literacy—and emphasize the significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities. They recommend six future research directions – competence for future workforce and its self-assessment measures, AI literacy or competency measures, new literacies and their relationships, interdisciplinary teaching, Innovative pedagogies and their evaluation, new assessment and its acceptance. © 2023 The Author

AB  - Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study investigates the relationship between the perceived benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and risks of generative AI (GenAI) tools and the fundamental factors of the TPB model (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control). The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students’ intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - Higher education is currently under a significant transformation due to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, the hype surrounding GenAI and the increasing influence of educational technology business groups over tertiary education. This commentary, prepared for the Special Issue of the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice (JUTLP) on “Enhancing student engagement using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chatbots,” delves into the complex landscape of opportunities and threats that AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, introduce to the realm of higher education. We argue that while GenAI offers promise in enhancing pedagogy, research, administration, and student support, concerns around academic integrity, labour displacement, embedded biases, environmental sustainability, increased commercialisation, and regulatory gaps necessitate a critical approach. Our commentary advocates for the development of critical AI literacy among educators and students, emphasising the necessity to foster an environment of responsible innovation and informed use of AI. We posit that the successful integration of AI in higher education must be grounded in the principles of ethics, equity, and the prioritisation of educational aims and human values. By offering a critical and nuanced exploration of these issues, our commentary aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how higher education institutions can navigate the rise of GenAI, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all stakeholders while upholding core academic values. © by the authors.

AB  - Background: Geriatric comanagement has been shown to improve outcomes of older surgical inpatients. Furthermore, the choice of discharge location, that is, continuity of care, can have a fundamental impact on convalescence. These challenges and demands have led to the SURGE-Ahead project that aims to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for geriatric comanagement in surgical clinics including a decision support for the best continuity of care option, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Objective: This qualitative study aims to explore the current challenges and demands in surgical geriatric patient care. Based on these challenges, the study explores the attitude of interviewees toward the introduction of an AI-supported CDSS (AI-CDSS) in geriatric patient care in surgery, focusing on technical and general wishes about an AI-CDSS, as well as ethical considerations. Methods: In this study, 15 personal interviews with physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and social workers, employed in surgical departments at a university hospital in Southern Germany, were conducted in April 2022. Interviews were conducted in person, transcribed, and coded by 2 researchers (AU, LB) using content and thematic analysis. During the analysis, quotes were sorted into the main categories of geriatric patient care, use of an AI-CDSS, and ethical considerations by 2 authors (AU, LB). The main themes of the interviews were subsequently described in a narrative synthesis, citing key quotes. Results: In total, 399 quotes were extracted and categorized from the interviews. Most quotes could be assigned to the primary code challenges in geriatric patient care (111 quotes), with the most frequent subcode being medical challenges (45 quotes). More quotes were assigned to the primary code chances of an AI-CDSS (37 quotes), with its most frequent subcode being holistic patient overview (16 quotes), then to the primary code limits of an AI-CDSS (26 quotes). Regarding the primary code technical wishes (37 quotes), most quotes could be assigned to the subcode intuitive usability (15 quotes), followed by mobile availability and easy access (11 quotes). Regarding the main category ethical aspects of an AI-CDSS, most quotes could be assigned to the subcode critical position toward trust in an AI-CDSS (9 quotes), followed by the subcodes respecting the patient’s will and individual situation (8 quotes) and responsibility remaining in the hands of humans (7 quotes). Conclusions: Support regarding medical geriatric challenges and responsible handling of AI-based recommendations, as well as necessity for a holistic approach focused on usability, were the most important topics of health care professionals in surgery regarding development of an AI-CDSS for geriatric care. These findings, together with the wish to preserve the patient-caregiver relationship, will help set the focus for the ongoing development of AI-supported CDSS. © Adriane Uihlein, Lisa Beissel, Anna Hanane Ajlani, Marcin Orzechowski, Christoph Leinert, Thomas Derya Kocar, Carlos Pankratz, Konrad Schuetze, Florian Gebhard, Florian Steger, Marina Liselotte Fotteler, Michael Denkinger.

AB  - Purpose: The major objectives of this study are to explore the perceptions of library practitioners towards IoT and to suggest directions for its proper application in university libraries of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducted an online questionnaire-based survey of library practitioners working at university libraries in Bangladesh in addition to an email interview with ten librarians. A sample size of 310 library practitioners was obtained using the convenience sampling technique for the survey. Non-parametric tests were performed to examine the differences in demographics and perspectives on IoT, as well as the potential benefits and challenges of IoT deployment in libraries. Findings: A total of 178 valid surveys were completed, and the results indicate that 147 (82.6%) library practitioners have varied degrees of IoT understanding and positive attitudes about IoT applications in libraries. The study identified RFID, wireless technologies, cloud computing, mobile apps, artificial intelligence and semantic search as major IoT enablers. Tracking, book reservation, circulation, user identification, service marketing, selection of resources, information networking and resource sharing, etc. are the main areas of a library where IoT may be applied. The integration of IoT has the potential to transform conventional libraries into smart libraries. However, there are some challenges that Bangladeshi university libraries must overcome to take use of the prospects emerged from IoT. Research limitations/implications: The study would encourage Bangladeshi librarians adopting IoT-based library and information services and provide guidelines for its successful implementation. Originality/value: The study is a pioneering effort from Bangladesh’s perspective which portrays the original opinions and perceptions of library practitioners regarding IoT applications in university libraries of Bangladesh. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Despite rapid AI integration in education globally, the role of socio-cultural and demographic factors in shaping AI adoption in diverse settings like the UAE remains underexplored. This study explores the accessibility, usability, and applicability of generative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on Emirati university students. Employing a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 83 students through demographic surveys and structured reflections based on Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (Gibbs, 1988). Quantitative analysis showed strong links between how Gen AI uses AI and demographic and educational factors, such as high school type, gender, and academic performance, with a slight trend seen for the father’s education level. Students from private international schools reported higher daily usage, while females showed greater weekly usage frequencies, emphasizing the influence of educational background and gender on technology adoption. Thematic analysis identified Gen AI accessibility as a key theme, with students highlighting the instant feedback and time-saving benefits of Gen AI tools. However, disparities in digital literacy and infrastructural challenges remain. The Gen AI Usability Study showed that students liked the detailed feedback and how it broke down complex ideas. However, they ran into problems like prompt sensitivity and the need to verify output. The Gen AI Applicability results emphasized ChatGPT’s help in creating content, improving language, and organizing academic material, but they also pointed out that it has trouble following assignment-specific rules. This study contributes to the literature by addressing socio-demographic factors influencing Gen AI adoption in a culturally diverse setting like the UAE. The results make it clear that Gen AI literacy and critical evaluation skills must be taught in schools, and strategies are necessary to ensure everyone has equal access (Ben Romdhane et al., 2023). Recommendations aim to help educators leverage Gen AI’s potential while mitigating its challenges in higher education. © (2024), (Russian Sociological Review). All rights reserved.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: This study examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, on higher education (HE). The ease with which content can be generated using GenAI has raised concerns across academia regarding its role in academic contexts, particularly regarding summative assessments. This research makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining university student and staff perceptions of current and future issues pertaining to the role of GenAI in universities. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method involving five one-to-one semi-structured interviews with four students and a lecturer explored the ethical and practical issues of GenAI text generation in academia. An inductive thematic analysis was chosen as it provided nuanced insights aligned with the study’s goals. Findings: Use of GenAI was discussed within the context of a range of topics, including perceptions of academic misconduct, authorial integrity and issues pertaining to university policies. Participants universally defined traditional classifications of academic misconduct but were unable to provide clear definitions where the use of GenAI was included for writing summative assessments. Students showed a more open engagement with GenAI, considering it a tool for overcoming obstacles rather than a means to plagiarise. Educators were generally more cautious and less optimistic about the academic role of GenAI. Lack of clear institutional policies surrounding such tools also contributed to ethical ambiguities. Originality/value: The study highlights diverging perspectives between students and academics, which necessitate a forum for dialogue, ensuring the need to develop clear policies to steer the integration of GenAI in a manner that is beneficial for students and academics. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Within educational linguistics and applied language studies, the debut of ChatGPT has spurred significant scholarship analyzing its potential benefits and consequences in language teaching and learning. However, limited empirical research on factors influencing language learners’ use or non-use of ChatGPT exists. From an ecological theoretical perspective, an understanding of this (non)usage is nevertheless essential: a nuanced understanding of if, how, and why language learners use these tools is necessary to craft meaningful approaches to ChatGPT and other similar generative AI tools in the language classroom. To address this gap, the current article reports on an online survey of 173 learners of non-English languages at a large public university in the United States. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and iterative qualitative coding (e.g., thematic analysis). Analysis revealed a large majority of participants (74%) elected not to use ChatGPT in their language learning. The article subsequently explores the factors that influenced this non-use, namely policies; concerns about ethics both inside and outside the language classroom (e.g., concerns about cheating, intellectual theft, and questions of fairness); beliefs about tool limitations; considerations of the potential negative impacts on language learning; and reflections on education more broadly. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to the role of digital literacies in language education; the production of knowledge in education; and the meaning of language study, including actionable items in the language classroom. © 2024 Emily A.

T2  - Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics
AB  - Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised higher education teaching and learning. AI has the power to analyse large amounts of data and make intelligent predictions thus changing the whole teaching and learning processes. However, such a rise has led to institutions questioning the morality of these applications. The changes have left librarians and educators worried about the major ethical questions surrounding privacy, equality of information, protection of intellectual property, cheating, misinformation and job security. Libraries have always been concerned about ethics and many go out of their way to make sure communities are educated about the ethical question. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has caught them unaware. Methods: This research investigates the preparedness of higher education librarians to support the ethical use of information within the higher and tertiary education fraternity. A qualitative approach was used for this study. Interviews were done with thirty purposively selected librarians and academics from universities in Zimbabwe. Results: Findings indicated that many university libraries in Zimbabwe are still at the adoption stage of artificial intelligence. It was also found that institutions and libraries are not yet prepared for AI use and are still crafting policies on the use of AI. Discussion: Libraries seem prepared to adopt AI. They are also prepared to offer training on how to protect intellectual property but have serious challenges in issues of transparency, data security, plagiarism detection and concerns about job losses. However, with no major ethical policies having been crafted on AI use, it becomes challenging for libraries to full adopt its usage. Copyright © 2025 Tsekea and Mandoga.

AB  - AI technology has already gone through one “winter,” and alarmist thinking may cause yet another one. Calls for a moratorium on AI research increase the salience of the public request for comment on “AI accountability.” Prohibitive approaches are an overreaction, especially when leveraged on virtual (non-embodied) AI agents. While there are legitimate concerns regarding expansion of AI models like ChatGPT in society, a better approach would be to forge a partnership between academia and industry, and utilize infrastructure of campuses to authenticate users and oversee new AI research. The public could also be involved with public libraries authenticating users. This staged approach to embedding AI in society would facilitate addressing ethical concerns, and implementing virtual AI agents in society in a responsible and safe manner. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Analisi
AB  - The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the cinematic field, particularly through synthetic audiovisual media based on deep learning, has paved new ways to explore novel narratives, aesthetics and representations of reality. This study investigates how filmmakers use AI to transform narrative and visual paradigms in the production of short films, focusing its analysis on submissions to two recent events: OpenDocs, organised by the companies Runway and Artefacto, which offers production support and AI-based creative tools to international documentarians; and the +RAIN festival, co-organised by the Pompeu Fabra University and SÓNAR+D, which screens AI-generated films and promotes discussion about the uses of this technology. Using a corpus consisting of 295 cinematic projects, the information submitted by the filmmakers, and the evaluations of the curatorial committees of both events, this study uses a qualitative methodology to analyse the integration of GenAI in developing new narrative and aesthetic works. The research is organised according to the application of AI in the selected projects: from the generation of original content to the modification of previous works.

T2  - Journal of Interactive Learning Research
AB  - The rise of AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini, presents both opportunities and challenges for higher education, particularly in writing instruction. This exploratory study examines a pedagogical approach that leverages LLM-generated feedback to engage students in detailed revision efforts, emphasizing the quality of iterative improvements over ungraded drafts. Students submitted drafts for AI feedback based on a rubric, revised their work, and were graded on the depth and quality of their revisions. Survey data from 39 undergraduate participants revealed that LLM feedback was clear, specific, and actionable, promoting deeper engagement with revisions and fostering independence. Students viewed this approach as ethical, aligning AI use with academic integrity while reducing the temptation to misuse AI for content creation. While some noted limitations, such as impersonal feedback, the overall reception was highly positive. By framing LLMs as tools for enhancement—or study partners, this study highlights their potential to support ethical, iterative learning and suggests promising directions for integrating AI into writing pedagogy in higher education. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

AB  - This study addresses researchers’ concerns about the effectiveness of integrating AI-assisted app design and training into university-level translation courses. It aims to explore how this integration influences students’ motivation, reflective practices, academic performance, and the quality of language translation. Employing a mixed-methods research approach with a two-group post-test-only design, the study uncovers the transformative influence of integrating an AI-based translation assistant. Purposive sampling techniques were utilised to conduct interventions and focus groups with students majoring in Philology enrolled in the 3 ECTS course in Industry-Specific Translation at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. The findings from the Independent Samples t-test revealed significant improvements in motivation, reflective practices, academic performance, and translation quality among students in the experimental group (EG) compared to the control group (CG). Thematic analysis using the Speak web-based tool indicated an overall positive sentiment (0.224), highlighting Positive and Very Positive sentiments. The Neutral category suggested a balanced perspective, while the combined Slightly Negative and Negative categories represented less favourable sentiment. This research contributes valuable insights to the discourse on AI in language education by addressing gaps in related literature. We suggest avenues for future research into linguistic nuances and contextual challenges, advocating ongoing exploration to maximise the benefits of these technological interventions. Ultimately, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of AI integration in language education and underscores the need for continued exploration and adaptation in this area. ©Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

T2  - Computers and Composition
AB  - Ethical frameworks for text generators (TGs) in education are generally concerned with personalized instruction, a dependency on data, biases in training data, academic integrity, and lack of creativity from students. While broad-level, institutional guidelines provide value in understanding the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) for the classroom, there is a need for a more ecological understanding of how AI ethics might be constructed locally, one that takes into account the negotiation of AI between teacher and student. This article investigates how an educational ethical framework for AI use emerges through a qualitative case study of one composition student's interaction with and understanding of using ChatGPT as a type of writing partner. Analysis of interview data and student logs uncover what we term an emergent “local ethic” – a framework that is capable of exploring unique ethical considerations, values, and norms that develop at the most foundational unit of higher education – the individual classroom. Our framework is meant to provide a heuristic for other writing teacher-scholars as they interrogate issues related to pedagogy, student criticality, agency, reliability, and access within the context of powerful AI systems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As a result of the inroads generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models such as ChatGPT have made into the higher education sector, there is an urgent need has arisen to investigate the types of GenAI policies South African higher education institutions (HEIs) have developed in response to GenAI. To date, no study has explored this aspect of South African higher education. With this in mind, this paper reports on an online rapid environmental review of the GenAI policies of 26 South African HEIs that were freely available on the websites of these HEIs or otherwise online. The main purpose of the paper is to establish whether these HEIs have institution-wide GenAI policies and, if so, what types of policies they are and what the contents of these policies comprise. The study employed a critical-ethics-based framing comprising six dimensions: the Siyavuma, semi-Siyavuma, critical, semi-critical, uBuntu and semi-uBuntu dimensions. It analyzed data through content and thematic analyses. Some of its findings are worth mentioning. Firstly, it discovered that five of the 26 South HEIs have their institution-wide GenAI policy documents freely available on their websites or online; one HEI has four such policy documents. The retrieved GenAI policy documents are mainly guides or guidelines. Secondly, academic staff and students are the main target audiences of the GenAI policy documents. Thirdly, ChatGPT is the most mentioned and the most cited GenAI tool in the reviewed policy documents. Fourthly, the responsible use of AI tools, GenAI and academic integrity, and risks and concerns of using GenAI tools feature as one instance of the main convergence points for the GenAI policy documents that spelled out their aims and their main foci. Lastly, six of the GenAI policy documents manifest elements of the critical dimension, whereas one GenAI policy document has features of the uBuntu dimension. The paper also makes relevant recommendations. © 2024 Society for Research and Knowledge Management. All rights reserved.

AB  - This manifesto critically examines the unfolding integration of Generative AI (GenAI), chatbots, and algorithms into higher education, using a collective and thoughtful approach to navigate the future of teaching and learning. GenAI, while celebrated for its potential to personalize learning, enhance efficiency, and expand educational accessibility, is far from a neutral tool. Algorithms now shape human interaction, communication, and content creation, raising profound questions about human agency and biases and values embedded in their designs. As GenAI continues to evolve, we face critical challenges in maintaining human oversight, safeguarding equity, and facilitating meaningful, authentic learning experiences. This manifesto emphasizes that GenAI is not ideologically and culturally neutral. Instead, it reflects worldviews that can reinforce existing biases and marginalize diverse voices. Furthermore, as the use of GenAI reshapes education, it risks eroding essential human elements— creativity, critical thinking, and empathy—and could displace meaningful human interactions with algorithmic solutions. This manifesto calls for robust, evidence-based research and conscious decision-making to ensure that GenAI enhances, rather than diminishes, human agency and ethical responsibility in education. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Oral assessment in computer-assisted language learning is one of the best-known challenges at a technical and implementation level in an official language certification. The case of Spain is especially critical since the government has delayed for years the completion of the listening comprehension and oral expression test in the University Access Test (EVAU). This article presents first the evolution of oral tests at a general level, then a SWOT analysis of the potential of such implementation, and, third, how to implement them and the paper concludes that there is evidence that chatbots adapted to language learning can also be used for evaluation. Chatbot-assisted language learning with artificial intelligence adapted to voice recognition and its processing to obtain semi-automatic assessment supervised by the teacher can become a tool to be implemented within the language learning processes and / or included in the language certification methodology. Another interesting aspect could be the development and design of the interfaces of future adapted chatbots that must consider multimodality in the interaction between man-machine so that communication is effective and can be validated based on the knowledge available to the student. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of Criminal Justice Education
AB  - Since the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar large language models in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become a significant societal force. Discourse about these developments through OpEds and blog posts have raised critical questions for educators about the promises and pitfalls of AI integration into higher education. Through an online survey administered to criminal justice educators (N = 68), the current study explores attitudes about and experiences with AI, and beliefs about the practical challenges AI presents. Results indicate criminal justice educators are both excited but also uncomfortable with the implications of AI for higher education. Respondents were generally concerned about the implications of AI for academic integrity and student development. Interestingly, respondents who had actually used AI tools expressed higher levels of excitement and comfort and lower levels of concern, suggesting that exposure to AI tools may play a key role in assuaging educators’ fears and concerns regarding AI tools. Additional findings and implications are discussed. © 2024 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - Incorporating AI tools like ChatGPT into higher education has been beneficial, yet the extent of user satisfaction with the quality of information provided by these tools, known as user information satisfaction (UIS) and information quality (IQ) theory, remains underexplored. This study introduces a UIS model specifically designed for ChatGPT's application in the educational sector based on multidimensions of IQ theory. Drawing from established UIS and IQ theory, we crafted a model centered around seven essential factors that influence the effective use of ChatGPT, aiming to guide educators and learners in overcoming common challenges such as plagiarism and ensuring the ethical use of AI. Data was collected from Indonesian university participants (N = 508) and analyzed using structural equation modeling with Smart-PLS 4.0. The results reveal that completeness, precision, timeliness, convenience, and information format are the most influential factors driving user satisfaction with ChatGPT. Interestingly, our research indicated that the accuracy and reliability of the information, typically deemed paramount, were not the primary concerns in the academic use of ChatGPT. Our findings recommend a cautious approach to integrating ChatGPT in higher education. We advocate for strategic use that recognizes its innovative potential while acknowledging its limitations, ensuring responsible and effective application in educational contexts. This balanced perspective is crucial for integrating AI tools into the academic fabric without compromising educational integrity or quality. Copyright © 2024 Chung-Jen Fu et al.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education. While universities have generally touted technological advancements as part of the fabric of their learning environments, the challenges to equitable outcomes for faculty and students related to the use of AI are under-recognized. There is scant work on the equity and morality of university AI policies and the implications for faculty within higher education institutions. While significant attention has been paid to the effect of tools like ChatGPT on student writing and academic integrity, less attention has been paid to how rapidly emerging AI policies affect other aspects of faculty work, and in potentially inequitable ways. This article considers AI policies at three large state universities to examine what policies are provided to faculty and their impacts, including instructional support for students, faculty research, and patents. Findings suggest that institutions vary greatly in terms of faculty guidance and far more work is needed to provide clear policies and resources regarding ethical AI for faculty. We discuss the implications, including challenges and opportunities for higher education institutions, and provide recommendations for moving forward as new technology continues to evolve. © 2024 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - More than a year has passed since reports of ChatGPT-3.5’s capability to pass exams sent shockwaves through education circles. These initial concerns led to a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary study to assess the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) against assessment tasks used across 10 engineering subjects, showcasing the capability of GenAI. Assessment types included online quiz, numerical, oral, visual, programming and writing (experimentation, project, reflection and critical thinking, and research). Twelve months later, the study was repeated using new and updated tools ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini, SciSpace and Wolfram. The updated study investigated the performance and capability differences, identifying the best tool for each assessment type. The findings show that increased performance and features can only heighten academic integrity concerns. While cheating concerns are central, opportunities to integrate GenAI to enhance teaching and learning are possible. While each GenAI tool had specific strengths and weaknesses, ChatGPT-4 was well-rounded. A GenAI Assessment Security and Opportunity Matrix is presented to provide the community practical guidance on managing assessment integrity risks and integration opportunities to enhance learning. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - ChatGPT has attracted the greatest attention in higher education, especially concerning how it can support and enhance learning and instructional activities. This paper aims to present a critical review of the advantages and disadvantages that result from integrating ChatGPT into higher education. This study designed an online questionnaire. The online questionnaires were shared with undergraduate students at three Jordanian universities: Applied Science Private University, Jerash, and Petra via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Email, and LinkedIn. According to this research, the advantages of CHATGPT are saving time, getting immediate answers to various questions, writing for projects and homework, aiding in language learning, unified feedback, further learning material, and greater accessibility of information. Of course, there are disadvantages too: less critical thinking, only partial language capacity, incomplete knowledge of subjects, developing dependency on technology, misinformation, data privacy, and biased responses. The study concludes by recommending CHATGPT as a useful source of information, but its users must be sensitive to limitations and possible inaccuracies about the subject matter; fact-checking procedures must be done to establish whether the material is correct. Further, great care must be taken when using ChatGPT professionally to protect sensitive and secret information. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications). All rights reserved.

AB  - This report examines a study focused on current interest areas and themes of business ethics in Australia as discussed in the Australian media (major national and State newspapers) across the years 2019–2022, using content analysis and stakeholder frame of focus. The identified themes are then compared with themes identified in the Global Survey of Business Ethics 2022–2024. These themes provide a framework to compare with themes identified as important for teaching and research through a survey of Australian university educators in business schools involved in ethics teaching and research in South Australia and Western Australia. Findings indicate that ethics and ethical concerns appear across a range of media publications in Australia which in turn is placing pressure on businesses to respond to this ethics talk in the media in explaining or justifying their actions. Although no particular pattern is identified from responses, some topics are gaining more prominence such as climate change and artificial intelligence, both in the media and in university courses and research. Topics of discussion were ranked from very important to important. It is concluded that ethical issues are important for Australian business and business is responding. Key ethical issues include climate change and sustainability, governance, government and transparency, and organizational culture with ethical issues of interest to Australia featuring including sport, corporate misconduct, and Indigenous issues. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This study combines the TAM and UGT frameworks to investigate how Vietnamese students' views of ChatGPT and intrinsic needs affect their intentions to use it for education (via variables including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, novelty, information seeking and academic content creation). We will employ TAM theory (Davis, 1989) and UGT theory to elucidate university students' motivations for utilising ChatGPT in Vietnam. Simultaneously, we aim to address the limitation stemming from data uniformity. Our research will make a substantial contribution to the understanding of researchers regarding the use of ChatGPT and its varied consequences as it grows and develops. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted at a private university in Vietnam with an estimated population of 15,000 students. One of Vietnam’s top private information technology institutions requires its students to use a variety of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on a regular basis to facilitate and enjoy their academic pursuits (Ngo, 2024; Nguyen). Students who are familiar with ChatGPT and have access to it for educational purposes are the ones that were chosen. This research is a quantitative study that utilises primary data through a survey method. Participants answered a questionnaire online through the Google Form platform sharing via social media platforms from October to December 2023. The questionnaire was divided into two sections: the first contained screening questions and demographic information and the second had five-point Likert-scale questions that measured the study’s components. Two screening questions are used to separate out the intended responders. (i.e. “I have heard the name ChatGPT” and “I know about ChatGPT”) were set to find whether the participants had any knowledge of ChatGPT. If participants were unaware of ChatGPT, their responses were not included in the study. A total of 283 responses were received. The participant’s demographic information is shown in Table 1. It is believed that a sample size of more than 200 provides adequate statistical power for data analysis in structural equation modelling. It is evident that the 283-sample size in this study is adequate to evaluate the research hypothesis and the fitting model. 42.9% of the 283 research samples were made up of men, while 57.1% were women. Business administration accounted for 40.1% of survey respondents, followed by information technology (25.2%) and English language (14.5%). The average ChatGPT usage time of respondents was 56 min in a single use. The study sample’s average age is 20–72 years old. Findings: The present study contributes to the existing AI chatbot literature in the educational industry in several ways. First, this study addresses a gap in the literature by investigating the factors that influence students’ ITU ChatGPT for educational purposes in Vietnam. Using the extended model, we investigated factors influencing students’ intentions to use ChatGPT. It integrates three motive factors of the UGT (ACT, IS and N) with the core factors of TAM (PeoU and PU). The integrated framework’s findings indicate that in a Vietnamese educational setting, ChatGPT is a novel technology that should be considered in conjunction with PU and PEoU. Research limitations/implications: First, only Vietnamese students make up the research sample. To increase the relevance of the findings, it is advised that future research look at the study model in various geographic regions. Second, the present investigation’s constraints arise from the lack of clarity about the Chat GPT version utilised by the respondents, specifically whether it was the free or premium edition. Furthermore, the limited duration of the survey presents an obstacle to gathering thorough data. Due to their reliance on the particular features and functionalities of the Chat GPT version used, these restrictions may have an effect on the researcher’s objectivity. Furthermore, the limited survey time may curtail the coverage of the collected answers, particularly considering that our survey predominantly focuses on business administration students, thus limiting the diversity and richness of the gathered data. We recommend that future studies should conduct comparative research between different versions of GPT Chat, including free and paid variants that can provide valuable insights into potential differences in performance and results. Such analysis can provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of different GPT Chat versions. Third, because the study focused on behavioural intention, actual usage and post-usage behaviour may not be covered by the findings. To gain a deeper understanding of users' actual behaviour, we suggest doing research on their usage and post-usage behaviours. Practical implications: The findings will assist service providers and legislators in determining critical variables and influencing students' incentives to use ChatGPT in educational settings that use constructivist teaching methods. As a result, the information will assist service providers in creating AI chatbots that are more user-friendly, visually appealing, efficient, safe and convenient for education. Governments, in conjunction with service providers, have the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of AI-based chatbots by highlighting their ethical and sustainable use. The findings demonstrate that students' ITU towards ChatGPT is substantially impacted by PU and PEoU. It is recommended that service providers emphasize the advantages and ease of use of AI chatbots in order to draw new clients. Additionally, in order to promote ChatGPT or related technologies, marketers should concentrate on raising the technology’s perceived novelty value. This is because people are open to new technologies as long as they believe they are interesting and innovative. Originality/value: ChatGPT is an advanced AI-powered chatbot that has the potential to advance and revolutionize the learning and teaching process. This study attempted to look at the elements that lead students to want to use ChatGPT from an academic standpoint by combining the UGT and TAM. For practitioners, academics and educators, the findings provide a solid knowledge of and encouragement for the sustainable use of such AI tools. Despite having important practical consequences, the study contains a number of limitations that indicate possible research gaps that should be filled by further investigation. © 2024, Thi My Danh Le, Huu Tri Nguyen Do, Kieu My Tran, Van Trung Dang and Bao Khanh Hong Nguyen.

TI  - Generative AI in student English learning in Thai higher education: More engagement, better outcomes?
AU  - Waluyo, B.
AU  - Kusumastuti, S.
T2  - Social Sciences and Humanities Open
AB  - Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking. © 2024 The Authors

AU  - Boraie, D.
T2  - Teaching English with Technology
AB  - Although there are claims that ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, is capable of assessing the writing of L2 learners accurately and consistently in the classroom, a number of recent studies have shown discrepancies between AI and human raters. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies investigating the intrareliability of ChatGPT scores. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT compared to teachers, as well as with itself, after being trained on a rubric. To accomplish this goal, the study adopted a quantitative correlational non-experimental design. A dataset of 100 writing assignments, submitted by a cohort of B1-level students at an international branch university in Egypt, was analyzed quantitatively. These assignments were initially evaluated and moderated by trained teachers (n=11), and subsequently, the same assignments were also assessed twice by ChatGPT. The findings indicated that teachers’ scores exhibited a higher level of accuracy compared to those generated by ChatGPT. The results also revealed that ChatGPT exhibits a moderate, yet questioned, level of intra-rater reliability. The weak-to-moderate correlations between ChatGPT and teacher scores raise concerns about the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT’s scoring of writing assignments. The implications of the findings highlight the potential applications and limitations of ChatGPT in L2 writing assessment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the use of AI technologies in language education and provides insights into the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT as an evaluation tool for L2 writing. © (2023), (University of Nicosia).

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in various medical fields, including diagnostic radiology as a tool for greater efficiency, precision, and accuracy. The integration of AI as a radiological diagnostic tool has the potential to mitigate delays in diagnosis, which could, in turn, impact patients’ prognosis and treatment outcomes. The literature shows conflicting results regarding patients’ attitudes to AI as a diagnostic tool. To the best of our knowledge, no similar study has been conducted in Saudi Arabia. Objective: The objectives of this study are to examine patients’ attitudes toward the use of AI as a tool in diagnostic radiology at King Khalid University Hospital, Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we sought to explore potential associations between patients’ attitudes and various sociodemographic factors. Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Data were collected from patients scheduled for radiological imaging through a validated self-administered questionnaire. The main outcome was to measure patients’ attitudes to the use of AI in radiology by calculating mean scores of 5 factors, distrust and accountability (factor 1), procedural knowledge (factor 2), personal interaction and communication (factor 3), efficiency (factor 4), and methods of providing information to patients (factor 5). Data were analyzed using the student t test, one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 382 participants (n=273, 71.5% women and n=109, 28.5% men) completed the surveys and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the respondents was 39.51 (SD 13.26) years. Participants favored physicians over AI for procedural knowledge, personal interaction, and being informed. However, the participants demonstrated a neutral attitude for distrust and accountability and for efficiency. Marital status was found to be associated with distrust and accountability, procedural knowledge, and personal interaction. Associations were also found between self-reported health status and being informed and between the field of specialization and distrust and accountability. Conclusions: Patients were keen to understand the work of AI in radiology but favored personal interaction with a radiologist. Patients were impartial toward AI replacing radiologists and the efficiency of AI, which should be a consideration in future policy development and integration. Future research involving multicenter studies in different regions of Saudi Arabia is required. ©Leena R Baghdadi, Arwa A Mobeirek, Dania R Alhudaithi, Fatimah A Albenmousa, Leen S Alhadlaq, Maisa S Alaql, Sarah A Alhamlan.

The proposed pedagogy is based on the authors’ primary experiences with the use of ChatGPT for their personal and pedagogical purposes and an unsystematic application of the pedagogy in EAP classes for undergraduate students at a law school of a university in Bangladesh. Our pre-application proposed innovative ChatGPT-mediated approach to vocabulary instruction is theoretically grounded in constructivism in language teaching and (web) technology in constructivist language pedagogy. The proposed pedagogy utilizes online newspapers with legal terminology, creating an interactive learning environment that encourages active participation and covers pronunciation, meaning, and spelling. It leverages primary language word definitions, refines pronunciation, fosters bilingual comprehension, and enhances spelling proficiency, offering a comprehensive learning experience. However, the study also predicts that the implementation of ChatGPT-based language instruction may involve challenges related to educator proficiency, student participation, resource limitations, and technology requirements. This study not only underscores the value of ChatGPT in language education but also paves the way for future research and innovation in the field. © University of Isfahan.

AB  - Background: The recent artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT seems to offer a range of benefits in academic education while also raising concerns. Relevant literature encompasses issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as well as pedagogy and educational affordances; yet, no real-life implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process has been reported to our knowledge so far. Objective: This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods: In March 2023, a total of 77 second-year dental students of the European University Cyprus were divided into 2 groups and asked to compose a learning assignment on "Radiation Biology and Radiation Protection in the Dental Office,"working collaboratively in small subgroups, as part of the educational semester program of the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology module. Careful planning ensured a seamless integration of ChatGPT, addressing potential challenges. One group searched the internet for scientific resources to perform the task and the other group used ChatGPT for this purpose. Both groups developed a PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) presentation based on their research and presented it in class. The ChatGPT group students additionally registered all interactions with the language model during the prompting process and evaluated the final outcome; they also answered an open-ended evaluation questionnaire, including questions on their learning experience. Finally, all students undertook a knowledge examination on the topic, and the grades between the 2 groups were compared statistically, whereas the free-text comments of the questionnaires were thematically analyzed. Results: Out of the 77 students, 39 were assigned to the ChatGPT group and 38 to the literature research group. Seventy students undertook the multiple choice question knowledge examination, and examination grades ranged from 5 to 10 on the 0-10 grading scale. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that students of the ChatGPT group performed significantly better (P=.045) than students of the literature research group. The evaluation questionnaires revealed the benefits (human-like interface, immediate response, and wide knowledge base), the limitations (need for rephrasing the prompts to get a relevant answer, general content, false citations, and incapability to provide images or videos), and the prospects (in education, clinical practice, continuing education, and research) of ChatGPT. Conclusions: Students using ChatGPT for their learning assignments performed significantly better in the knowledge examination than their fellow students who used the literature research methodology. Students adapted quickly to the technological environment of the language model, recognized its opportunities and limitations, and used it creatively and efficiently. Implications for practice: the study underscores the adaptability of students to technological innovations including ChatGPT and its potential to enhance educational outcomes. Educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into curriculum design; awareness programs are warranted to educate both students and educators about the limitations of ChatGPT, encouraging critical engagement and responsible use.  ©Argyro Kavadella, Marco Antonio Dias da Silva, Eleftherios G Kaklamanos, Vasileios Stamatopoulos, Kostis Giannakopoulos.

AB  - Machine learning methods for the identification of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) have been previously studied, however, they have serious limitations. Firstly, the training sets used to train the appropriate machine learning algorithms were not previously annotated by a forensic expert in anthropology. Secondly, previously presented solutions have rarely used models trained using real pornographic content involving children. Thirdly, previous studies have not presented a detailed justification for the classification decisions made, which is important due to the recent guidelines of the European Commission (Artificial Intelligence Act). The aim of the study was to train convolution neural networks (CNNs) using expert-labelled CSAM images and thereby identify the elements of the body and/or the environment that are critical for classifications by the neural network. To train and evaluate machine learning models, we used 60,000 images equally divided into four classes (CSAM images, images displaying sexual activity involving adults, images of people without sexual activity, and images not containing people). We used four neural network architectures: MobileNet, ResNet152, xResNet152 and its modification ResNet-s, designed for the purpose of research. The trained models provided high accuracy of classifying CSAM images: xResNet152 (F1 = 0.93, 92,8%), xResNet-s (F1 = 0.93, 93,1%), ResNet152 (F1 = 0.90, 91,39%), MobileNet (F1 ranged from 0.85 to 0.87, accuracy ranged from 86% to 87%). The results of the conducted research suggest that using expert knowledge (in sexology and anthropology) significantly improved the accuracy of the models. In regard to further anthropological analysis, the results indicate that the breasts, face and torso are crucial areas for the classification of pornographic content with children's participation. Results suggests that the ResNet-s neural network may be a reliable tool for clinical work and to support the work of experts witnesses in the field of anthropology. The study design received a positive opinion of the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw. The clinical material was used for research purposes with the consent of the relevant prosecutor's offices.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Education
AB  - Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering innovative solutions and enhancing the efficiency of processes aimed at achieving these goals. There is a perceived need for studies which may look at these connections. Against this background, this paper reports on a study that investigated the connections between artificial intelligence and the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at higher education institutions. The paper deployed a multi-methods approach. The first one was a bibliometric analysis of publications in the topic. The second method used was an assessment of a set of case studies, that illustrate how artificial intelligence is being deployed among a sample of universities in support of efforts to implement the SDGs and a survey aimed at identifying current and future trends. The data gathered allow some trends to be identified. For instance, that there is a wide range of applications of AI to sustainability in High Education Institutions (HEI), to be chosen in terms of campus operations and greening, outreach and community engagement, research, teaching and learning, and university management. Also, the paper has identified successful examples of the deployment of AI in various sustainability contexts, illustrating what are the success factors for them. Moreover, the survey identified the fact that the use of AI is quite widely spread, and is likely to increase in coming years, due to a greater demand. Finally, AI also poses several challenges, such as authenticity and ethics in assessment (case studies), ‘lack of access to software/materials’, and ‘lack of information technology training for myself/my colleagues’ (survey). Overall, AI offers a powerful toolset to accelerate and enhance the implementation of the UN SDGs. By analysing vast datasets, predicting outcomes, optimising processes, and providing new insights, AI has the potential to address complex sustainability challenges across various sectors. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

It identifies key obstacles to the use of the global values among students such as limited awareness and insufficient supportive programmes. This study is important in its emphasis in integrating universal values such as justice, equality, and environmental protection into curricula and university activities to using these principles among students. This work examines the current state of the global value systems, the requisite basics for its effective use, the challenges faced in university, and the technology role to enhance these values. The study collected data by means a questionnaire administered to a sample of 211 university students. The study found that high level of acceptance of the global value systems, with a general mean response score of 4.19 out of 5. Particularly, the "empathy and compassion as fundamental human values" had a mean score of 4.32. The actualisation of the global values is triggered "integrating ethical values into curricula to promote integrity and honesty" (M = 4.20). The key challenges were "the gap between theory and practice" (M = 4.17). This article suggests strategies for addressing these challenges-encouraging student participation in research projects for enhancing critical thinking (M = 4.19). According to the findings, the study developed educational and training programmes for faculty members and recommended initiatives like cultural exchange programmes and higher volunteer activities in universities. In addition, it stresses the significance of future research for evaluating the effect of these recommendations and exploring the use of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, for the promotion of the global values among students. © 2024 JESTP.

AB  - Despite the media hype and contentious debate surrounding generative artificial intelligence technologies, there is a dearth of research on how these technologies are perceived by the general public. This study aimed to bridge this gap by investigating (a) how people perceive the risks and benefits of ChatGPT and (b) the antecedents of such perceptions. A U.S. national survey (N = 1,004) found that individuals with higher education levels, interest in politics, knowledge about ChatGPT, leftist ideology, a sense of personal relevance, and a skeptical view of science tend to perceive greater risks associated with ChatGPT. These results challenge the conventional “knowledge deficit” model, suggesting that negative perceptions of technology are not merely a result of insufficient knowledge; such perceptions can also stem from a critical mindset that approaches artificial intelligence technology with caution. In contrast, individuals who have previously used ChatGPT, regard it as personally relevant to their lives, and show a keen interest in new media technologies in general tend to recognize its benefits. These patterns suggest that risk perceptions involve more complex cognitive information processing, while benefit perceptions often arise from relatively intuitive decision-making processes. Our findings underscore the vital role of science communication and education in facilitating informed discussions about the risks and benefits of emerging technologies like ChatGPT. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Languages
AB  - ChatGPT, a general-purpose intelligent chatbot developed by OpenAI, has introduced numerous opportunities and challenges in the field of language education. With its remarkable ability to generate diverse forms of text, answer questions, and provide translations within minutes, ChatGPT has become an influential tool in the era of advanced AI technology. However, to what extent ChatGPT can be used to assist students in completing language learning tasks remains largely unexplored. Against this background, this study aimed to investigate students’ experiences with ChatGPT and their perceptions of its role in language learning through a small-scale qualitative study. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews with five students at a top-tier international university in China. Students’ responses revealed that ChatGPT has the potential to serve as a valuable learning partner and aid students in completing language-related tasks. Furthermore, participants exhibited critical judgment in evaluating the quality of ideas and outputs generated by ChatGPT, as well as the ability to modify prompts to maximize learning benefits. Such critical judgment offsets the potential threats to academic integrity posed by ChatGPT. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the potential of ChatGPT in language education by adding empirical evidence from students’ perspectives. This study supports the idea that ChatGPT can work as an effective tool for providing students with immediate feedback and personalized learning experiences. Such findings generate implications for future pedagogical practices in the new era by providing students with personalized guidance, designing technology-embedded language support, and developing students’ lifelong learning skills (e.g., autonomy and evaluative judgment) with the support of ChatGPT. © 2023 by the authors.

T2  - Informatics
AB  - According to a recent study by OpenAI, Open Research, and the University of Pennsylvania, large language models (LLMs) based on artificial intelligence (AI), such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), may have potential implications for the job market, specifically regarding occupations that demand writing or programming skills. This research points out that interpreters and translators are one of the main occupations with greater exposure to AI in the US job market (76.5%), in a trend that is expected to affect other regions of the globe. This article, following a mixed-methods survey-based research approach, provides insights into the awareness and knowledge about AI among Portuguese language service providers (LSPs), specifically regarding neural machine translation (NMT) and large language models (LLM), their actual use and usefulness, as well as their potential influence on work performance and the labour market. The results show that most professionals are unable to identify whether AI and/or automation technologies support the tools that are most used in the profession. The usefulness of AI is essentially low to moderate and the professionals who are less familiar with it and less knowledgeable also demonstrate a lack of trust in it. Two thirds of the sample estimate negative or very negative effects of AI in their profession, expressing the devaluation and replacement of experts, the reduction of income, and the reconfiguration of the career of translator to mere post-editors as major concerns. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - The Ethics of Emotional Artificial Intelligence: A Mixed Method Analysis
AU  - Ghotbi, N.
T2  - Asian Bioethics Review
AB  - Emotions play a significant role in human relations, decision-making, and the motivation to act on those decisions. There are ongoing attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to read human emotions, and to predict human behavior or actions that may follow those emotions. However, a person’s emotions cannot be easily identified, measured, and evaluated by others, including automated machines and algorithms run by AI. The ethics of emotional AI is under research and this study has examined the emotional variables as well as the perception of emotional AI in two large random groups of college students in an international university in Japan, with a heavy representation of Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and other Asian nationalities. Surveys with multiple close-ended questions and an open-ended essay question regarding emotional AI were administered for quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. The results demonstrate how ethically questionable results may be obtained through affective computing and by searching for correlations in a variety of factors in collected data to classify individuals into certain categories and thus aggravate bias and discrimination. Nevertheless, the qualitative study of students’ essays shows a rather optimistic view over the use of emotional AI, which helps underscore the need to increase awareness about the ethical pitfalls of AI technologies in the complex field of human emotions. © 2022, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the education sector, leading to the closure of schools to prevent the spread of the virus. With the Philippine government approving the reopening of face-to-face classes in colleges and universities, there is a need to ensure that the academic community is protected from the risks associated with COVID-19. This study developed a Fuzzy Logic-based model to measure the risk associated with COVID-19 transmission in Northeastern Mindanao State University-Tagbina campus. The research design employed in this study involved the development of the Fuzzy Logic-based model, which was validated by experts in the field to assess COVID-19 risk transmission. The developed model produced satisfactory results after expert validation, and the campus had a 38.5% risk, classified as "Low," based on the developed model. Despite challenges in opinions of multiple experts, the model was able to draw conclusions to support campus management’s decision-making pertaining to campus risk of COVID-19 transmission. The developed model can be used as a decision-support tool for campus administration to implement certain modalities and policies that do not pose a high COVID-19 risk to the academic community. Further studies can explore the applicability of the developed model to other higher education institutions and settings. © 2023, Research and Development Institute Suan Dusit University.

T2  - Journal of Academic Librarianship
AB  - This study aims to investigate the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the university libraries of Pakistan. Following the explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, this study was completed in two phases. In the first phase, quantitative data was collected from 237 university librarians from across Pakistan. In the second phase, 10 purposefully selected university librarians were interviewed. The results reveal that Pakistani university libraries are using limited AI-based library services including text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, Google Assistant to search by voice command, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system for self-checkout, check-in, and security purposes, and intelligent data analysis for collection management. This study explored key factors that influence implementation of AI applications including highly integrated technological infrastructure, funding/cost associated with AI, collaboration between AI experts and professionals, and library users' feedback. The major identified challenges were the requirement of a highly networked and integrated environment, lack of budget, high cost of AI technologies, and lack of staff expertise. This study claims to implement the first comprehensive survey of AI applications in Pakistani university libraries at the national level. The research findings would support library and university administrators to integrate AI applications in libraries not only in Pakistan but also in other developing countries. © 2023

AB  - This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on loss in decision-making, laziness, and privacy concerns among university students in Pakistan and China. Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The invention of ChatGPT and generative AI technologies presents educators with significant challenges, as concerns arise regarding students potentially exploiting these tools unethically, misrepresenting their work, or gaining academic merits without active participation in the learning process. To effectively navigate this shift, it is crucial to embrace AI as a contemporary educational trend and establish pedagogical principles for properly utilizing emerging technologies like ChatGPT to promote self-regulation. Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools, educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators, instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers. This paper proposes three key pedagogical principles for integrating AI chatbots in classrooms, informed by Zimmerman’s Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework and Judgment of Learning (JOL). We argue that the current conceptualization of AI chatbots in education is inadequate, so we advocate for the incorporation of goal setting (prompting), self-assessment and feedback, and personalization as three essential educational principles. First, we propose that teaching prompting is important for developing students’ SRL. Second, configuring reverse prompting in the AI chatbot’s capability will help to guide students’ SRL and monitoring for understanding. Third, developing a data-driven mechanism that enables an AI chatbot to provide learning analytics helps learners to reflect on learning and develop SRL strategies. By bringing in Zimmerman’s SRL framework with JOL, we aim to provide educators with guidelines for implementing AI in teaching and learning contexts, with a focus on promoting students’ self-regulation in higher education through AI-assisted pedagogy and instructional design. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, ChatGPT has become a noteworthy subject in the educational field due to the popularity it gained among students all over the world. Applications such as text creation, data processing, and curriculum development, among other applications, prove that ChatGPT is one of the most advanced chatbots available, albeit it posing a series of challenges that prevents students from developing their critical thinking skills in some cases. In this sense, this study’s objective is to analyze the current literature regarding the use of ChatGPT in higher education. The study questions its usage, the overall impact it has on education, and the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence- (AI) assisted learning, all within the research area of digital education. For this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted across multiple journal databases, analyzing the articles found and filtering them with the use of specific criteria. The results of this analysis afforded the conclusion that that ChatGPT can potentially enhance both academic- and librarian-related processes, although it is important to reconsider the ethics of using technology such as this. This is because this kind of AI technology also has the potential to modify the way people take on different jobs, tasks, and processes at an academic level, for which the correct and responsible use of ChatGPT needs to be assessed in the field of higher education. © Authors.

TI  - Open Book Exams and Flexible Grading Systems: Post-COVID University Policies from a Student Perspective
AU  - Kang, D.
T2  - Behavioral Sciences
AB  - Due to COVID-19, many universities have started offering real time video or recorded courses. This situation raises concerns about a decline in students’ learning outcomes and issues of unfairness regarding students’ exams and grade evaluations. Korean universities have introduced online open book testing in courses and a flexible pass grading system that allows students to select their final grades to improve fairness. This research investigates students’ thoughts and reasons for the test and the system through a questionnaire with 109 respondents and statistical methods such as nonparametric tests, multinomial regression and text-mining. Many students supported both the testing and the grading system, presenting balanced viewpoints by comparing their cons and pros. This finding suggests that these policies could be helpful in enhancing fairness in grade evaluation, relieving students of the learning burden and increasing their satisfaction. This study offers the implications that universities must develop standardized exam formats as well as various learning options in a rapidly changing situation with educational innovation (e.g., hyperscale and generative artificial intelligence). © 2023 by the author.

TI  - Course Prophet: A System for Predicting Course Failures with Machine Learning: A Numerical Methods Case Study
AU  - Caicedo-Castro, I.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - In this study, our purpose was to conceptualize a machine-learning-driven system capable of predicting whether a given student is at risk of failing a course, relying exclusively on their performance in prerequisite courses. Our research centers around students pursuing a bachelor’s degree in systems engineering at the University of Córdoba, Colombia. Specifically, we concentrate on the predictive task of identifying students who are at risk of failing the numerical methods course. To achieve this goal, we collected a dataset sourced from the academic histories of 103 students, encompassing both those who failed and those who successfully passed the aforementioned course. We used this dataset to conduct an empirical study to evaluate various machine learning methods. The results of this study revealed that the Gaussian process with Matern kernel outperformed the other methods we studied. This particular method attained the highest accuracy (80.45%), demonstrating a favorable trade-off between precision and recall. The harmonic mean of precision and recall stood at 72.52%. As far as we know, prior research utilizing a similar vector representation of students’ academic histories, as employed in our study, had not achieved this level of prediction accuracy. In conclusion, the main contribution of this research is the inception of the prototype named Course Prophet. Leveraging the Gaussian process, this tool adeptly identifies students who face a higher probability of encountering challenges in the numerical methods course, based on their performance in prerequisite courses. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education has sparked significant interest. Artificial intelligence offers opportunities for global learning, personalized instruction, and efficient resource management. In research writing, AI tools streamline processes, from a literature review to data analysis, enhancing efficiency and freeing up time for critical thinking. The researchers of this study used text mining techniques to extract patterns and trends of using writing assistance tools in research from the responses of 327 faculty researchers in various higher learning institutions in the Philippines. Unigram tokenization was used to present the 10 most frequently used words in the corpus, while the k-means elbow method was utilized to show the optimal number of clusters. Sentiment analysis was use to show the positive and negative implications of using writing assistance tools in research. The finding is that faculty respondents value writing assistance tools for enhancing research writing by expediting processes and improving clarity. The implementation of these tools in selected higher learning institutions may present difficulties, such as issues related to overreliance, and hinder students’ and researchers’ development of critical thinking and writing skills. Along with technological and resource challenges, these tools could inadvertently encourage plagiarism if not used responsibly. Cultural and language considerations are also relevant because these tools may not always be attuned to the specific linguistic and cultural nuances of Filipino academic writing. The results of this research may serve as a guide for researchers, educators, and software developers, who may use AI to streamline research writing processes in the educational sector. ©Authors.

TI  - What do telecommunications policy academics have to fear from GPT-3?
AU  - Howell, B.E.
AU  - Potgieter, P.H.
T2  - Telecommunications Policy
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 have shot to prominence recently (Lin 2023), as dramatic advances have shown them to be capable of writing plausible output that is difficult to distinguish from human-authored content. Unsurprisingly, this has led to concerns about their use by students in tertiary education contexts (Swiecki et al. 2022) and it has led to them being banned in some school districts in the United States (e.g. Rosenblatt 2023; Clarridge 2023) and from at least one top-ranking international university (e.g. Reuters 2023). There are legitimate reasons for such fears to be held, as it is difficult to differentiate students’ own written work presented for assessment from that produced by the AI tools. Successfully embedding them into educational contexts requires an understanding of the tools, what they are, and what they can and cannot do. Despite their powerful modelling and description capabilities, these tools have (at least currently) significant issues and limitations (Zhang & Li 2021). As telecommunications policy academics charged with the research-led teaching and supervising both undergraduate and research students, we need to be certain that our graduates are capable of understanding the complexities of current issues in this incredibly dynamic field and applying their learnings appropriately in industry and policy environments. We must be reasonably certain that the grades we assign are based on the students’ own work and understanding, To this end, we engaged in an experiment with the current (Q1 of 2023) version of the AI tool to assess how well it coped with questions on a core and current topic in telecommunications policy education: the effects of access regulation (local loop unbundling) on broadband investment and uptake. We found that while the outputs were well-written and appeared plausible, there were significant systematic errors which, once academics are aware of them, can be exploited to avoid the risk of AI use severely undermining the credibility of the assessments we make of students’ written work, at least for the time being and in respect of the version of chatbot software we used. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Multimodal learning analytics—In-between student privacy and encroachment: A systematic review
AU  - Prinsloo, P.
AU  - Slade, S.
AU  - Khalil, M.
T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - Abstract: Since the emergence of learning analytics (LA) in 2011 as a distinct field of research and practice, multimodal learning analytics (MMLA), shares an interdisciplinary approach to research and practice with LA in its use of technology (eg, low cost sensors, wearable technologies), the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and the provision of automated, mostly real-time feedback to students and instructors. Much of MMLA takes place in experimental and laboratory settings, researching students' learning in in-between spaces—between research and classroom application, in-between students' learning in private and public spaces as researchers track students' learning both in their use of social media and connected devices, and through the use of context-aware and adaptive devices; and lastly, in-between respecting students' privacy while increasingly using intrusive technologies. This study seeks to establish what is known about MMLA in terms of rationale for applications, the nature and scope of data collected, the study contexts, evidence of commercial interests and/or downstream uses of students' data, and consideration of ethics, privacy, and the protection of student data. This systematic review analysed 192 articles using a search string consisting of various combinations of multimodal (data) and learning analytics. The main findings include, inter alia, that though MMLA provide insights into learning and teaching, there is little evidence of MMLA findings successfully being applied to classroom settings, at scale. Given that the nature of MMLA research often necessitates the use of a range of (intrusive) sensors and recording technologies and can include children in its samples; the encroachment of students' right to privacy is a huge concern that is not addressed. There is also a need to reconsider the rationale for collecting multimodal data, the conditions under which such data collection will be ethical and in service of students' wellness, and the boundaries that should protect their (multimodal) data. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Experimental educational research predates both multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) and educational data mining (EDM). MMLA has been an integral part of learning analytics as research focus and practice since its inception. The increased digitisation and datafication, advances in technology (eg, sensor technology, geo-tracking, etc.) and a growing normalisation of wearable technologies provides greater scope for collecting multimodal data. There is a vast body of published MMLA research providing a range of insight into students' and educators' behaviours aiming to increase the effectiveness of teaching. What this paper adds While there are several studies providing insights into the state of MMLA research, this study provides insight to a selected range of factors in MMLA research such as the type of research (empirical/conceptual); the nature and scope of data collected; the sample populations (pre-higher education, higher education, etc.); evidence of commercial interests or consideration of downstream uses; issues pertaining to consent, privacy, data protection and ethics; and evidence of how findings were used to improve teaching and learning. The vast majority of MMLA research targets higher education, is empirical in nature and is based on relatively small samples of participation in experimental settings. Confirms previous research that found the predominance of small samples, and a lack of replicability and, as a result, lacking scalability. That there is very little explicit discussion of the ethical and privacy implications and data protection, either at design stage or for future implementation. Similarly, that there is little consideration of potential commercial interests or downstream uses of data. Implications for practice and/or policy MMLA in its essence requires interdisciplinary approaches and teams. For MMLA to move beyond small-scale, experimental settings to application in real (classroom) settings, larger, replicable studies should be conducted together with ways to make study findings actionable for teachers and students. Ethical issues, commercial interests and downstream uses of collected data must be considered within the design and approval of MMLA research. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.

T2  - Artseduca
AB  - Objectives: This study investigated the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the professional development of faculty members at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A survey with 63 participants assessed AI utilization, developmental potential, implementation processes, and adoption barriers, using statistical methods like ANOVA and regression. Results: Findings showed moderate AI integration for innovation and excellence, but lacked skills training. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant correlation between increased AI usage and improvements in teaching and learning outcomes. Participants recognized AI’s capacity for adaptive teaching aligned with evolving curricula, promoting student engagement. However, effectiveness scores for an AI-powered work culture indicated deficiencies in institutional vision and integration, exacerbated by insufficient analytical skills training. Despite challenges, optimizing AI adoption significantly improved educational quality, with the primary obstacle being the absence of quality training programs. Conclusion: In conclusion, faculty professional development relied on AI adoption, showing potential if capacity-building barriers are addressed. Recommendations include awareness initiatives, addressing concerns, enhanced training, and supportive policies for cultivating an electronic work culture. Future research should provide evidence-based guidelines for AI deployment in education. © 2023, Artseduca. All rights reserved.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Education Technology
AB  - One of the biggest challenges in higher educational institutions is to avoid students’ failures. Globally student dropout is a serious issue. Risk of dropouts can be identified at an earlier stage using machine learning classifiers, as they have gained more popularity in both academia and industry. The research team suggests that early prediction facilitates educators and higher education administrators to take necessary measures to prevent dropouts. Data for the research were collected from 530 Indian students when they were engaged in online learning during pandemic crisis. This research work involves two phases. In first phase, hybrid ensemble strategy is focused that integrates two powerful machine learning algorithms namely Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for early at-risk prediction. The result is a fast procedure for classification of at-risk students which is competitive in accuracy and highly robust. Prediction models are developed using ensemble learning, furthermore ensemble models are combined into a single meta-model, which provides best outcomes to enable higher education institutions for predictive analysis. Moreover, it correctly classified students’ at-risk regarding accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score with values of 93%, 91.52%, 96.42% and 93.91% respectively. In second phase, prediction model is deployed by creating a web application using. Net framework to sense students’ sentiments using Azure cognitive services text analytics (Application Programming Interface) API for detecting cognitive behavioral outcomes in online learning environment. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - A Composite Resilience Index (CRI) for Developing Resilience and Sustainability in University Towns
AU  - Abdul-Rahman, M.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Globally, most higher educational institutions can no longer house their students within their campuses due to the increased number of enrolments and the unavailability of land for spatial expansion, especially in urban areas. This leads to studentification which negatively impacts university towns. Developing resilience against the negative impacts of studentification will make university towns more sustainable. However, there is no existing community resilience index designed for that purpose. Thus, this study develops a composite resilience index for university towns, using Akoka, a university town in Lagos, Nigeria, as a case study. The composites of the index were determined by prioritizing online user-generated content mined from Twitter between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2021 using artificial intelligence, while the elements of resilience and risk reduction were developed through the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process. The research outcomes showed that the physical, economic, social, and cultural criteria subjected to comparisons represented ≥70% of the total weights. These criteria made up the outcome indicators, while the integrated community-based risk reduction program model was adopted for the process indicators. Both outcome and process indicators formed the localized composite resilience index for Akoka, Lagos, Nigeria. This proposed composite resilience index would help the town to assess and build resilience against the negative impacts of studentification and provide a methodology for other university towns to create theirs using similar methods. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Implications for Academic Cheating: Expanding the Dimensions of Responsible Human-AI Collaboration with ChatGPT and Bard
AU  - Oravec, J.A.
T2  - Journal of Interactive Learning Research
AB  - Cheating is a growing academic and ethical concern in higher education. The technological “arms race” that involves cheating-detection system developers versus technology-savvy students is attracting increased attention to cheating issues; it is also generating iterations of technological innovations as corporations, higher educational institutions, and legal experts attempt to control the situation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has added new dimensions to academic cheating challenges as students (as well as faculty and staff) can easily access powerful systems for generating content that can be presented in assignments, exams, or published papers as their own. AI methodology is also providing some emerging anti-cheating approaches, including facial recognition and watermarking. This paper provides an overview of human/AI collaboration approaches and frames some educational misuses of ChatGPT as forms of “misattributed co-authorship.” As with other kinds of collaborations, the work that students produce with AI assistance can be presented in transparent and straightforward modes or (unfortunately) in opaquer and ethically-problematic ways. However, rather than just for catching or entrapping students, the emerging varieties of technological cheating-detection strategies can be used to assist students in learning how to document and attribute properly their AI-empowered as well as human-human collaborations. Construing misuses of ChatGPT as misattributed co-authorship can recognize the growing capabilities of AI systems and how stressing responsible and mindful usage by students can help prepare them for a highly collaborative, AI-saturated future. © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

AB  - Asian American students have experienced additional physical and emotional hardships associated with the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased xenophobic and anti-Asian discrimination. This study investigates different coping patterns and risk factors affecting Asian and non-Asian college students in response to COVID-19 challenges by studying the differences in their responses within four domains after the onset of the pandemic: academic adjustment, emotional adjustment, social support, and discriminatory impacts related to COVID-19. We first employed a machine learning approach to identify well-adjusted and poorly adjusted students in each of the four domains for the Asian and non-Asian groups, respectively. Next, we applied the SHAP method to study the principal risk factors associated with each classification task and analyzed the differences between the two groups. We based our study on a proprietary survey dataset collected from U.S. college students during the initial peak of the pandemic. Our findings provide insights into the risk factors and their directional impact affecting Asian and non-Asian students’ well-being during the pandemic. The results could help universities establish customized strategies to support these two groups of students in this era of uncertainty. Applications for international communities are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

T2  - Development and Learning in Organizations
AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to provide better understanding on this phenomenon, as well as some recommendations to assist in preparing Al technology and its related aspects during crisis like Covid period and beyond. Design/methodology/approach: The study consisted of two phases. Phase one focused on identifying top higher education institutions according to the QS world university ranking. As a result, 180 higher education institutions in the Arab region were found, with the 2022 QS Arab region university ranking. The study selected top 20 performing institutions. Each institution has been assessed according to six metrics including: international student ratio, international research network, international ration, Web impact, citation per page and paper per faculty. Phase two explored the adapted Al applications and their related aspects that are used in each institution using a learning online questionnaire. Pilot tests were used to determine the validity and reliability of the measures. Findings: Numerous factors that lead to enhancing high education using Artificial Intelligence in higher education institutions have emerged from this study. These factors include; knowledge management, trust, learning, technical resources and complexity. First, effective knowledge management assists in maintaining information in a place where it is easy to share and access. Second, trust is considered a critical factor in dealing with uncertainties like covid-19. It needs to be effectively addressed by students and staff members, especially in higher education. Without trust, decisions cannot be successfully made and actions may be delayed or stalled. Third, continuous learning is a key factor that tends to enhance the capability of dealing with new routines or potential challenges. Fourth, technical resources refer to electronic devices and tools that are used by students and academics to interact and share knowledge. Originality/value: Students and faculty academics perceive things and use Al technology differently, which can lead to misunderstanding and create tension between them. Many higher education institutions have adapted great Al technology applications, but they are significantly less proficient than previously thought at understanding how to leverage this technology to produce helpful solutions to their business difficulties. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate attitudes of both students and teachers concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the L2 classroom. The study was a descriptive, qualitative, mixedmethods case study whose data were taken from a purposive, convenient sample at a private, English-speaking university during the Summer Semester 2023 in Beirut, Lebanon. Data collection primarily involved an online survey on Google forms which was given to a sample of 49 students taking a research-based English 202 course of which 46 were completed. Afterwards, six English teachers and six students were chosen based on their voluntary will to participate in individual interviews for the former and semi-structured focus group interviews for the latter. The findings revealed that approximately 85% of students did indeed use AI unethically to get ideas for their assignments, assist them in their projects' “blue-prints” or do their assignments/projects altogether. The findings also revealed that a “love/hate” relationship seemed to dictate students' relationships with AI, where students did indeed make use of AI but were distrusting of it for privacy and equity concerns. Finally, findings also revealed that most of the interviewed instructors' readiness to undergo training for AI was more to monitor students' potential misuse of it. The article purposes a suggestive revamping of course learning objectives due to students' inclinations to misuse AI to do their coursework with 89.4% of students willing to use AI to complete their coursework should university punitive measures be removed; furthermore, the article equally proposes future research investigating the impact and use of AI in the higher educational classroom on student performance and that it be used with a “grain of salt” as it may unleash a Pandora's box of future generations graduating without the necessary know-how in delicate professions of medicine, nursing, engineering, architecture among others. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The utilisation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education has been a contemporary issue attracting varied perspectives. However, the nuances among the antecedents of AI usage among postgraduate students and the acquisition of 21st-century employability skills are under-researched. This study sought to fill the chasm by adopting a concurrent integrated mixed method to collect data using a questionnaire with closed-ended and open-ended items from 294 postgraduate students in Ghana. Descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques were employed for the quantitative data analyses while thematic pattern matching was used to analyse the qualitative data gathered. Results from the descriptive analysis revealed that the most prevalent AI platforms used by postgraduate students were ChartGPT and Quillbot. The two most important uses of such AI tools were just used for learning in general; and searching for literature. The PLS-SEM paths modelling showed that antecedents of postgraduate students' AI usage were benefits, challenges and platform availability. Finally, both AI usage and AI challenges were significant predictors of postgraduate students’ acquisition of 21stcentury employability skills. However, the relationship between AI challenges and the acquisition of 21st-century employability skills was fully mediated by AI usage. Based on the results, recommendations were made for policy and practice of AI usage in higher education. © 2023

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore whether immersive virtual reality (VR) can complement e-participation and help alleviate some major obstacles that hinder effective communication and collaboration. Immersive virtual reality (VR) can complement e-participation and help alleviate some major obstacles hindering effective communication and collaboration. VR technologies boost discussion participants' sense of presence and immersion; however, studying emerging VR technologies for their applicability to e-participation is challenging because of the lack of affordable and accessible infrastructures. In this paper, the authors present a novel framework for analyzing serious social VR engagements in the context of e-participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a novel approach for artificial intelligence (AI)-supported, data-driven analysis of group engagements in immersive VR environments as an enabler for next-gen e-participation research. The authors propose a machine-learning-based VR interactions log analytics infrastructure to identify behavioral patterns. This paper includes features engineering to classify VR collaboration scenarios in four simulated e-participation engagements and a quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach performance. Findings: The authors link theoretical dimensions of e-participation online interactions with specific user-behavioral patterns in VR engagements. The AI-powered immersive VR analytics infrastructure demonstrated good performance in automatically classifying behavioral scenarios in simulated e-participation engagements and the authors showed novel insights into the importance of specific features to perform this classification. The authors argue that our framework can be extended with more features and can cover additional patterns to enable future e-participation immersive VR research. Research limitations/implications: This research emphasizes technical means of supporting future e-participation research with a focus on immersive VR technologies as an enabler. This is the very first use-case for using this AI and data-driven infrastructure for real-time analytics in e-participation, and the authors plan to conduct more comprehensive studies using the same infrastructure. Practical implications: The authors’ platform is ready to be used by researchers around the world. The authors have already received interest from researchers in the USA (Harvard University) and Israel and run collaborative online sessions. Social implications: The authors enable easy cloud access and simultaneous research session hosting 24/7 anywhere in the world at a very limited cost to e-participation researchers. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the very first attempt at building a dedicated AI-driven VR analytics infrastructure to study online e-participation engagements. © 2022, Lukasz Porwol, Agustin Garcia Pereira and Catherine Dumas.

AB  - This paper examines the potential benefits and challenges of using the generative AI model, ChatGPT, in higher education, in the backdrop of the constructivist theory of learning. This perspective-type study presents five benefits of ChatGPT: the potential to facilitate adaptive learning, provide personalised feedback, support research and data analysis, offer automated administrative services, and aid in developing innovative assessments. Additionally, the paper identifies five challenges: academic integrity concerns, reliability issues, inability to evaluate and reinforce graduate skill sets, limitations in assessing learning outcomes, and potential biases and falsified information in information processing. The paper argues that tertiary educators and students must exercise caution when using ChatGPT for academic purposes to ensure its ethical, reliable, and effective use. To achieve this, the paper proposes various propositions, such as prioritising education on the responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT, devising new assessment strategies, addressing bias and falsified information, and including AI literacy as part of graduate skills. By balancing the potential benefits and challenges, ChatGPT can enhance students’ learning experiences in higher education. © 2023.

AB  - This article investigates the perspectives of Romanian academics on implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE). The article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies’ leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of academics, to gains in the learning–teaching process, improvements in students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves, and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results of this research is mainly empirical and practical. These opinions should be used as resources for managers of HE institutions to develop better policies concerning the implementation of AI in HE and for strategic vision toward AI, with the ultimate purpose of achieving progress and prosperity for the entire society. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Measuring emotions in education using wearable devices: A systematic review
AU  - Ba, S.
AU  - Hu, X.
T2  - Computers and Education
AB  - Wearable devices that detect real-time and fine-grained physiological signals offer potentials for understanding the intricate mechanisms of emotions in education. However, due to the diversities of wearable devices, physiological signals, educational emotions, and educational contexts, there is lack of consensus on the affordance and constraints of wearable devices for measuring emotions in education. The present study conducted a systematic literature review and examined 50 peer-reviewed journal articles and influential proceedings published over the last 15 years (January 2008 to December 2022). Five research questions were addressed concerning research backgrounds, theoretical frameworks, methodologies, remaining challenges, and ethical considerations. Findings demonstrated that while most studies focused on university students in controlled environments, recent advances in wearable devices have enabled emotion measurements of younger learners in natural settings. Research interests have developed towards understanding the theoretical connections between emotion and cognition leveraging wearable devices. Electrodermal activity and heart rate were the most frequently measured signals whereas “engagement”, “positive”, and “anxiety” were the most studied emotions. Machine learning and inferential statistics were often adopted to examine associations between physiological signals and educational emotions. Moreover, we identified a need for updated ethical guidelines in advanced data collection using wearable devices. This review can not only inform wearable device usages in educational practices but also shed light on future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - We present a wide-ranging interview with Stefan Popenici, a distinguished scholar and public speaker with extensive experience in higher education. Popenici’s research focuses on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on teaching, learning, quality assurance, and student engagement in higher education. The interview delves into the themes of his book, Artificial Intelligence and learning futures: Critical narratives of technology and imagination in higher education (2023), exploring the intersection of AI, intelligence, and societal issues such as eugenics and racism. Popenici critiques the power of tech titans and the belief in technology as a panacea, especially in higher education. The discussion also addresses the identity crisis in higher education, the potential of revisiting Humboldt’s 19th-century vision of the university, and the challenges and opportunities presented by the AI revolution. Popenici’s insights into the role of AI in assessment, graduate and academic employment, and the future of academic work are particularly illuminating. The interview concludes with Popenici’s reflections on his own educational journey and future plans. © 2023. Stefan Popenici, Jürgen Rudolph, Shannon Tan & Samson Tan.

TI  - The use and abuse of artificial intelligence-enabled machine translation in the EFL classroom: An exploratory study
AU  - Alharbi, W.
T2  - Journal of Education and e-Learning Research
AB  - The integration of machine translation (MT) and artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced the precision of MT systems producing translations that rival the quality of skilled human translators. This innovation has broadened the applicability of AI-enabled MT systems attracting users for a variety of purposes. This paper explores the following areas: the application of AI-enabled MT, specifically Google Translate (GT) in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. Empirical findings and recent research indicate that students are increasingly reliant on MT particularly in higher educational settings where English is not their first language. The purpose of this research is to provide insight on the practices, beliefs and goals of EFL learners who use GT in the classroom. Data was gathered from 234 university students through a questionnaire along with pre- and post-tests to compare the quality of writing drafts created with and without the aid of GT. The findings are consistent with those of previous research conducted worldwide highlighting the immense potential of AI-enabled MT in not only boosting students' learning experiences but also cultivating more independent learners. The study also indicates that students have positive attitudes towards GT and employ diverse search strategies to address various language-related challenges. © 2023 by the author.

TI  - Accurate, timely, and portable: Course-agnostic early prediction of student performance from LMS logs
AU  - Santos, R.M.
AU  - Henriques, R.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - In higher education, providing personalized feedback and support to students is a significant challenge. Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness. © 2023

TI  - Smartphone addiction avoidance via inherent ethical mechanisms and influence on academic performance
AU  - Okpara, S.-M.N.
T2  - Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies
AB  - Due to smartphones’ high use and penetration, it has become pertinent to interrogate addiction issues concerning inbuilt user control mechanisms and relative use for academic enhancement among university students. Based on the postulations of the uses and the gratification theory and utilitarian theory of ethics, it has been framed that smartphones are not the key issue but how smartphones are used. The study adopted a survey research design using a questionnaire instrument to collect data from 250 students at a university in Lagos, Nigeria. The findings revealed that smart attachment and addiction are extremely high among the students. However, user controls are not just a matter of default inbuilt ethical control mechanisms, but also deliberately habitual towards academically relevant outcomes. It was also revealed that how one uses smartphones and what one uses smartphones for, are more critical to academic performance than understanding and satisfaction with the inherent inbuilt control mechanism. In essence, good management of smartphone attachment or addiction issues is more of a matter of habit than it is about inherent ethical smartphone controls. The study, therefore, concluded that manufacturers must take active measures to align smartphone ethical inherent controls with emerging artificial intelligence. Such synergy would suffice to orient users toward improvement. Also, active smartphone user philosophy for self-benefitting purposes is vital. In other words, both manufacturers and users of smartphones have a role in smartphone attachment–addiction management–not just ethical inherent control mechanisms. © 2023 by authors;.

AB  - This study is a qualitative study to understand perception regarding the use of ChatGPT in their argumentative writing. Argumentative writing equips students with the opportunity to emulate scientists, allowing them to collect data, analyse, and justify their findings while addressing research questions. This method has been proven to enhance both their learning and critical thinking abilities. However, with the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, which are becoming increasingly popular among university students, concerns have emerged about their potential impact on students' capacity to craft argumentative papers. This study delves into these concerns, focusing on students' perceptions of ChatGPT's role in their argumentative writing endeavours. Employing qualitative research methods, seventeen students were selected as respondents using purposive sampling. The respondents were tasked with reflecting on this issue. The results from the analysis of documents indicated that although students acknowledge the extensive capabilities of ChatGPT, including its ability to provide information and guidance and decrease both research expenses and time consumption, they also voice apprehensions. These include doubts about ChatGPT's accuracy, potential over-reliance which could diminish their learning and critical thinking, and the looming risk of plagiarism. The study suggests that while embracing these tools can help produce meaningful argumentative writing more efficiently, caution must be taken to avoid unchecked use of ChatGPT in writing. © 2023, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - With a focus on enhancing national scientific and technological competitiveness and cultivating innovative talents, STEM education has achieved remarkable results in developing students’ core quality and improving academic achievement. Online courses built for STEM education have attracted many learners. However, as the number of learners continues to grow, online STEM education faces problems such as difficulties in ensuring the quality of teaching and learning in STEM online courses and poor performance of students in online learning. An in-depth exploration of the correlations between learners’ E-learning behavior categories and learning outcomes in STEM education online courses will facilitate teachers’ precise interventions for students who are learning online. This study first predicts the E-learning performance of STEM course learners through machine learning and deep learning algorithms, then uses factor analysis methods to discover correlations between behavioral features, uses the random forest algorithm to explore the vital behavioral features that influence the E-learning performance of STEM courses, and finally performs a category classification of important characteristic behaviors based on the learning behavior category basis. The results show that the learning behavior classifications of learning preparation behavior, knowledge acquisition behavior, and learning consolidation behavior affect the E-learning performance of learners in STEM courses. Moreover, a series of characteristic behaviors strongly affect E-learning performance. In general, teachers can systematically intervene in time for at-risk students from the perspective of learning behavior categories and further improve the construction of STEM online courses. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on decision-making, laziness, and privacy concerns among university students of Delhi NCR (India) and Fujairah (UAE). As AI technologies are increasingly adopted in various sectors, including education, to tackle contemporary challenges, there is a growing investment in AI, projected to reach USD 253.82 million between 2021 and 2025. However, while researchers and institutions worldwide praise the positive role of AI, this study sheds light on the concerns associated with its implementation. This study utilizes a qualitative methodology employing PLS-Smart for data analysis. The primary data was collected from 315 students representing various universities in Delhi NCR (India) and Fujairah (UAE). The sample was drawn using purposive sampling techniques from the population. The findings of the data analysis demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) has a significant impact on human decision-making, laziness, and security and privacy concerns. The results indicate that 68.9% of human laziness, 68.6% of personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% of the loss of decision-making can be attributed to the influence of AI in Delhi and Fujairah. Notably, human laziness emerges as the most affected area due to artificial intelligence. © 2023, Journal of Content, Community and Communication. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - What ChatGPT means for universities: Perceptions of scholars and students
AU  - Firat, M.
T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - This study investigates the implications of ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, for students and universities by examining the perceptions of scholars and students. The responses of seven scholars and 14 PhD students from four countries – Turkey, Sweden, Canada and Australia – are analysed using a thematic content analysis approach. Nine key themes emerge from the findings. According to their frequency of recurrence, these themes are: “Evolution of learning and education systems”, “changing role of educators”, “impact on assessment and evaluation”, “ethical and social considerations”, “future of work and employability”, “personalized learning”, “digital literacy and AI integration”, “AI as an extension of the human brain”, and “importance of human characteristics”. The potential benefits of AI in education as well as the challenges and barriers that may arise from its integration are discussed in the context of existing literature. Based on these findings, suggestions for future research include further exploration of the ethical implications of AI for education, the development of strategies to manage privacy concerns, and the investigation of how educational institutions can best prepare for the integration of AI technologies. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the potential opportunities and challenges associated with AI in higher education and the need for continued research in this area. © 2023.

AB  - This study investigates university teachers’ relationships with emerging technologies by focusing on the uptake of artificial intelligence in higher education practices. We utilise an experimental philosophy approach to i) determine university teachers’ intuitions around universities’ responsibilities to adopt new artificial intelligence technologies, ii) understand the conditions under which university teachers consider artificial intelligence defensible and, hence, would be willing to introduce such tools and services into their daily practice and iii) specify teachers’ self-reported knowledge of artificial intelligence. An online survey, where participants were sent one of three different cases (Case A related to first-generation students, Case B, an archetypical student, Case C, students with a learning disability), and 18 identical questions across all three cases. The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices. © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Library Hi Tech
AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the latest digital transformation (DT) technological trends the university library can use to provide library users with alternative educational services. AI can foster intelligent decisions for retrieving and sharing information for learning and research. However, extant literature confirms a low adoption rate by the university libraries in using AI to provide innovative alternative services, as this is missing in their strategic plan. The research develops (AI-LSICF) an artificial intelligence library services innovative conceptual framework to provide new insight into how AI technology can be used to deliver value-added innovative library services to achieve digital transformation. It will also encourage library and information professionals to adopt AI to complement effective service delivery. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a qualitative content analysis to investigate extant literature on how AI adoption fosters innovative services in various organisations. The study also used content analysis to generate possible solutions to aid AI service innovation and delivery in university libraries. Findings: This study uses its findings to develop an Artificial Intelligence Library Services Innovative Conceptual Framework (AI-LSICF) by integrating AI applications and functions into the digital transformation framework elements and discussed using a service innovation framework. Research limitations/implications: In research, AI-LSICF helps increase an understanding of AI by presenting new insights into how the university library can leverage technology to actualise innovation in service provision to foster DT. This trail will be valuable to scholars and academics interested in addressing the application pathways of AI library service innovation, which is still under-explored in digital transformation. Practical implications: In practice, AI-LSICF could reform the information industry from its traditional brands into a more applied and resolutely customer-driven organisation. This reformation will awaken awareness of how librarians and information professionals can leverage technology to catch up with digital transformation in this age of the fourth industrial revolution. Social implications: The enlightenment of AI-LSICF will motivate library professionals to take advantage of AI's potential to enhance their current business model and achieve a unique competitive advantage within their community. Originality/value: AI-LSICF development serves as a revelation, motivating university libraries and information professionals to consider AI in their strategic plan to enable technology to support university education. This act will enable alternative service delivery in the face of unforeseen circumstances like technological disruption and the present global COVID-19 pandemic that requires non-physical interaction. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Application of blockchain technology in libraries and information centers services
AU  - Jha, S.K.
T2  - Library Hi Tech News
AB  - Purpose: As information providers, libraries select, acquire, process, store, preserve and distribute information resources to customers. Innovative technologies like the blockchain have posed major challenges to education and library services. The main goal of the application of blockchain technology (BT) in libraries and information centers is to give all possible users in participating library systems unrestricted access to digital content and print collections while minimizing risk to protect each user’s privacy and identification. A fresh and dependable technology called blockchain aids in the security, reliability and preservation of information. The 21st century’s change agents’ libraries are implementing new technologies to deliver the most knowledge possible in the shortest amount of time. It cannot be overstated how this technology has the potential to transform library services, operations and functions. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive review of literature on “smart libraries” was carried to ascertain the emerging technologies in the smart library domain. Literature was searched against various keywords like smart libraries, smart technologies, Internet of Things, electronic resource management, data mining, artificial intelligence, ambient intelligence, BT and augmented reality. Later on, the works citing the literature on smart libraries were also explored to visualize a broad spectrum of emerging concepts about this growing trend in libraries. Findings: Blockchain is one of the rapidly expanding and evolving technology. Librarians and library need to understand the opportunities, benefits and risks of blockchain. Perhaps in libraries, BT will become a useful tool for storing, storing and sharing information. This technology also aids in the acquisition of library materials that can improve collection maintenance. Blockchain can protect user and patron records and enhance the privacy of user and research data. This technology also improves collaboration among library patrons and staff. BT is increasingly being adopted by libraries in various ways. It creates an improved metadata system to protect digital-first selling rights, peer-to-peer sharing and more. Apart from what have been already discussed, this technology is perfect for academia and perfect for achieving potential pace in libraries. It can be used to safeguard library user records, retrieve libraries document and improve collection management. A special bulk request enables identification and discovery of unique holdings. Scientific writing is another good use case for blockchain, where researchers can record and time-stamp ideas and spread information. BT presents a significant opportunity for libraries to enhance user privacy, enhance collaboration and transform the manner in which libraries and communities collaborate. The University of San Jose in Toronto, the Reference Library, the Suffolk Collaborative Library System and many other libraries are exploring this technology, and various other libraries are set to follow suit. Originality/value: The paper tries to highlight the usage of blockchain technologies in the libraries and information center setups for the efficient working of library setups. Blockchain is one of the emerging technologies that have the potential to bring the technology revolution. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: ChatGPT is a conversational large language model that has the potential to revolutionize knowledge acquisition. However, the impact of this technology on the quality of education is still unknown considering the risks and concerns surrounding ChatGPT use. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the usability and acceptability of this promising tool. As an innovative technology, the intention to use ChatGPT can be studied in the context of the technology acceptance model (TAM). Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a TAM-based survey instrument called TAME-ChatGPT (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption) that could be employed to examine the successful integration and use of ChatGPT in health care education. Methods: The survey tool was created based on the TAM framework. It comprised 13 items for participants who heard of ChatGPT but did not use it and 23 items for participants who used ChatGPT. Using a convenient sampling approach, the survey link was circulated electronically among university students between February and March 2023. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess the construct validity of the survey instrument. Results: The final sample comprised 458 respondents, the majority among them undergraduate students (n=442, 96.5%). Only 109 (23.8%) respondents had heard of ChatGPT prior to participation and only 55 (11.3%) self-reported ChatGPT use before the study. EFA analysis on the attitude and usage scales showed significant Bartlett tests of sphericity scores (P<.001) and adequate Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measures (0.823 for the attitude scale and 0.702 for the usage scale), confirming the factorability of the correlation matrices. The EFA showed that 3 constructs explained a cumulative total of 69.3% variance in the attitude scale, and these subscales represented perceived risks, attitude to technology/social influence, and anxiety. For the ChatGPT usage scale, EFA showed that 4 constructs explained a cumulative total of 72% variance in the data and comprised the perceived usefulness, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, and behavior/cognitive factors. All the ChatGPT attitude and usage subscales showed good reliability with Cronbach α values >.78 for all the deduced subscales. Conclusions: The TAME-ChatGPT demonstrated good reliability, validity, and usefulness in assessing health care students’ attitudes toward ChatGPT. The findings highlighted the importance of considering risk perceptions, usefulness, ease of use, attitudes toward technology, and behavioral factors when adopting ChatGPT as a tool in health care education. This information can aid the stakeholders in creating strategies to support the optimal and ethical use of ChatGPT and to identify the potential challenges hindering its successful implementation. Future research is recommended to guide the effective adoption of ChatGPT in health care education. ©Malik Sallam, Nesreen A Salim, Muna Barakat, Kholoud Al-Mahzoum, Ala'a B Al-Tammemi, Diana Malaeb, Rabih Hallit, Souheil Hallit.

AB  - The advent of transformative technologies, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool, significantly impacts the future of education, society, and the economy. Drawing on the theory of knowledge socialism and public goods, this paper critically examines the potential impact of ChatGPT in the context of China's high-tech development and higher education. We believe these technologies resonate with the principles of knowledge socialism by promoting decentralization, openness, and collective intelligence and are poised to reshape the education sector and beyond. The non-competitive and non-exclusive nature of ChatGPT makes it a public good with significant social benefits. In the educational domain, it has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning by providing students with convenient, personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and multilingual support. However, despite its benefits, educators, and users must work to overcome its limitations, such as limited expertise, language understanding, reasoning skills, and potential risks associated with privacy, security, and misinformation. This article discusses the need to prepare students for a future heavily impacted by ai, which requires a reassessment of digital literacy and competencies. Doing so would require leveraging ai tools and promoting human-centered approaches, developing higher-order thinking skills, emphasizing emotional education, and teaching academic ethics. In addition, introducing ai tools like ChatGPT in higher education requires regulation to prevent plagiarism and improve independent problem-solving. This paper further explores the impact of ChatGPT on China's technological development. The global attention attracted by ChatGPT has stimulated the growth of the ai industry and prompted the emergence of domestic products and applications in countries such as China. It is critical to harmonize the enforcement of competition laws and capitalize on the contributions of sizable enterprises in the realm of technological innovation and research. © 2023 Beijing International Review of Education.

AU  - Crawford, J.

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - The OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3, or Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer was released in November 2022 without significant warning, and has taken higher education by storm since. The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars. Practitioner Notes 1. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 has taken higher education by storm with threats of plagiarism and integrity as key concerns. 2. We argue that effective teacher leadership is needed to develop student character so they use ChatGPT for good, rather than for personal benefit. 3. ChatGPT can create new and innovative authentic assessment in higher education. 4. ChatGPT offers students the opportunity to simplify the learning process to create less distraction, and more flow. © 2023, University of Wollongong. All rights reserved.

AU  - Honcharuk, T.
T2  - International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning
AB  - This paper highlights the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and text-generating models such as ChatGPT (GPT-Generative Pretrained Transformer) on Ukrainian education. It has been found that the introduction of this tool is both beneficial and problematic. On the one hand, it saves time for the information search, facilitates the research process for both teachers and students through proposing ideas, and creates education-related content that emulates human writing. On the other hand, ChatGPT sometimes outputs biased or unverified information that causes misunderstanding among the participants in the educational process. Moreover, in the case of inappropriate application, this tool limits the creativity of the students and decreases their critical thinking skills. The research is based on a survey (Google Forms) distributed through Facebook groups and university networks all over Ukraine. 1035 educational and pedagogical practitioners and teachers took part in the study. The results obtained from the respondents indicate that there are opportunities for the successful implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process. A significant majority of 83.6% of the respondents confirmed that the impact of AI depends on its usage. The survey also highlights various areas for ChatGPT improvements, such as “understanding context,” “giving more accurate answers,” “improving visual capability,” etc. However, it is inevitable to understand that combining human intellectual capability and ChatGPT potential goes beyond the boundaries of human possibilities, speeds up the process of innovative idea generation, and enables the educational process to be more meaningful and effective. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

AU  - Nikum, K.
T2  - Journal of Engineering Education Transformations
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to shows the required educational system which drives to the societal needs. In higher education programs, the quality edification continues to deteriorate irrespective of paying supplementary attention. There are many factors which influenced the education system and at each steps our perception is changed and developed. The problem is arisen when industry 4.0 of the twenty-first century is came with emerged technologies, which takes one step ahead with automation technologies like IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning in all manufacturing technologies and making smart industries. The motive of education is to realize the truth of current scenario of industries, society and country. The main challenge and constraint of education required changes in educators’ attitude, textbooks, curriculum, education technologies, pedagogies, innovation, research, reforms and policies of education 4.0. The education 5.0 is more about people than technologies. All these challenging parts can be overcome by creating values to identify the creative potential of human beings by enhancing education system known as education 5.0. The answer of all societal problems is continuously overcome by problems solving attitude through rehumanizing values among students as well as in educators. In this regard, to know the all-education philosophy and update learning practices to implement education 5.0 has been discussed. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the current popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and a steady increase in publications over time, few studies have investigated AI in public contexts. As a result, assumptions about the drivers, challenges, and impacts of AI in government are far from conclusive. By using a case study that involves a large research university in England and two different county councils in a multiyear collaborative project around AI, we study the challenges that interorganizational collaborations face in adopting AI tools and implementing organizational routines to address them. Our findings reveal the most important challenges facing such collaborations: a resistance to sharing data due to privacy and security concerns, insufficient understanding of the required and available data, a lack of alignment between project interests and expectations around data sharing, and a lack of engagement across organizational hierarchy. Organizational routines capable of overcoming such challenges include working on-site, presenting the benefits of data sharing, reframing problems, designating joint appointments and boundary spanners, and connecting participants in the collaboration at all levels around project design and purpose. © The Author(s) 2020.

T2  - Data and Policy
AB  - The 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessed the quality of university research in the UK. 20% of the assessment was allocated according to peer review of the impact of research, reflecting the growing importance of impact in UK government policy. Beyond academia, impact is defined as a change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment, or quality of life. Each institution submitted a set of four-page impact case studies. These are predominantly free-form descriptions and evidences of the impact of study. Numerous analyses of these case studies have been conducted, but they have utilised either qualitative methods or primary forms of text searching. These approaches have limitations, including the time required to manually analyse the data and the frequently inferior quality of the answers provided by applying computational analysis to unstructured, context-less free text data. This paper describes a new system to address these problems. At its core is a structured, queryable representation of the case study data. We describe the ontology design used to structure the information and how semantic web related technologies are used to store and query the data. Experiments show that this gives two significant advantages over existing techniques: improved accuracy in question answering and the capability to answer a broader range of questions, by integrating data from external sources. Then we investigate whether machine learning can predict each case study's grade using this structured representation. The results provide accurate predictions for computer science impact case studies.  © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Moral Awareness of College Students Regarding Artificial Intelligence
AU  - Ghotbi, N.

T2  - Asian Bioethics Review
AB  - To evaluate the moral awareness of college students regarding artificial intelligence (AI) systems, we have examined 467 surveys collected from 152 Japanese and 315 non-Japanese students in an international university in Japan. The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion and robots’ rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI (3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned about AI control of society (− 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were less concerned about unemployment (− 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more concerned about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05). The study concludes that the moral awareness of college students regarding AI technologies is quite limited and recommends including the ethics of AI in the curriculum. © 2021, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is the fourth industrial revolution, and in higher education it will fundamentally transform the work of academics and higher education administrators. AI will also have several implications for students, including a reconsideration of what sorts of skills and knowledge should be taught and developed in the academy to prepare students for digital working lives. As social work educators, we have begun to wonder what the implications of AI in the academy will have for social work education. For educators, there are implications for pedagogy that go well beyond the introduction of new digital tools that merely integrate into existing teaching models and practices. This is because AI will not simply add to existing teaching modes and practices, but will fundamentally transform teaching and learning. Drawing on recent literature and research into in AI and higher education, this article explores possible future implications for social work education. We identify the transformative and disruptive potential of AI in higher education, and consider how this intersects with the ethical and relational side of social work as a profession. Implications for social work education are canvassed  © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The British Association of Social Workers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The government of the United Kingdom is offering significant amounts of funding to increase engagement between researchers and technology companies involved in the “creative economy”, a sector worth £100b per annum. The sector has naturally evolved into clusters involving actors as diverse as the BBC, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and freelance game designers. It collaborates and competes with multinational powerhouses including Google, Microsoft, and Pixar. The imbrication of academic researchers in the sector makes it a good example of the extension of academia to industry, raising ethical but also methodological and practical questions. This article describes a project that embedded a research software engineer (RSE) from a digital humanities (DH) laboratory into a small technology start-up engaged in high risk R&D of an immersive narrative story-telling platform. The platform is enabled by artificial intelligence and has the capacity to remember user input and modify narrative options and character mood accordingly. The team included a researcher specialising in narrative theory and digital production. The project demonstrated the utility of the critical application of DH methods and the need to develop career pipelines to produce people capable of working at the intersection of higher education and industry. © 2022, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

TI  - Mapping the Efficacy of Artificial Intelligence-based Online Proctored Examination (OPE) in Higher Education during COVID-19: Evidence from Assam, India
AU  - Rahman, A.
T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - The COVID-19-induced lockdown forced education institutes to use different synchronous and asynchronous assessment techniques. The present study is a case investigation of the Artificial Intelligence-based Online Proctored Examination (OPE) adopted by Nowgong College (Autonomous), Assam, India, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It follows a hybrid approach to understand the OPE mechanisms; to consider challenges faced therein; to assess its efficacy based on students' perception and satisfaction; and finally, to ascertain the perceived issues and concerns of students. Information from multiple sources was gathered including semi-structured interview with representatives of the exam controlling body, document analysis, observation and a survey of 209 randomly selected students; different parameters of OPE, constructed as per the attributes of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), were considered. The qualitative data were analysed thematically, while the quantitative data were analysed according to frequency, percentage, mean, sd and one sample t-test. The results revealed that additional costs, lack of compatible devices, low bandwidth in rural areas, technical inability of students are the major challenges in implementing OPE successfully. Students' perception of OPE was found to be significantly positive and the sampled students were significantly satisfied with their overall experiences in OPE. However, students were found to be significantly negative and reluctant about its future use, as they experienced various technical and financial issues, and were concerned about the environmental and psychological aspects. Thus, the insights from this study yield significant implications for stakeholders, which could assist in ensuring a robust and scalable OPE in the future.  © Authors.

TI  - Mining the ambient commons: building interdisciplinary connections between environmental knowledge, AI and creative practice research
AU  - Field, A.
T2  - Interdisciplinary Science Reviews
AB  - According to Brooks [2017. “The Big Problem with Self-driving Cars Is People”. IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News], artificial intelligence has had a variable track-record of usefulness in situations where context and environmental knowledge are responsible for shaping human interactions. In 2021, providing contextually aware training to supervised machine learning is still a non-trivial task for AI models that involve complex systems. In addition, knowledge held only across distributed members of a community, within culture, or tacitly within the wider environment of the ambient commons [McCullough 2013. Ambient Commons: Attention in the Age of Embodied Information. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] evades consistent generalizable modelling–even in technical domains such as traffic flow management, atmospheric chemistry, or the prediction of election results. Yet it is precisely these interactions of context, community, culture and environment that also define how music can be created. The creative arts can themselves be thought of as a complex system. Assuming that creativity is non-generalizable, this paper assesses creative processes through a humanities-centric lens of machine learning and robotics, aiming to better understand relationships between context, environment and experimental system in artistic research. These relationships are now themselves significantly digitally mediated, requiring a change in academic discourse away from artefacts which need discrete research justification towards a more holistic, and often non-linear view of networks that require cultural situation. In doing so, issues of creative accountability [Field 2021. “Changing the Vocabulary of Creative Research: The Role of Networks, Risk, and Accountability in Transcending Technical Rationality.” In Sound Work: Composition as Critical Technical Practice, edited by J. Impett, 303–317.Orpheus Institute Series. Leuven: Leuven University Press] and the implications of substituting “creative question” for “research question” are examined within creative research. Early twentieth century ideas related to progressivism which have instrumentalized creative practice, particularly where technology forms part of art making, are challenged by re-thinking change through new models. The Three Horizons change model [Sharpe 2016. “Three Horizons: A Pathways Practice for Transformation.” Ecology and Society 21 (2): 47] originally intended to describe environmental ecosystems, is assessed as a practical tool for designing creative research. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The way people travel, organise their time, and acquire information has changed due to information technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are mechanisms that evolved from data management and developing processes. Incorporating these mechanisms into business is a trend many different industries, including education, have identified as game-changers. As a result, education platforms and applications are more closely aligned with learners’ needs and knowledge, making the educational process more efficient. Therefore, AI and ML have great potential in e-learning and higher education institutions (HEI). Thus, the article aims to deter-mine its potential and use areas in higher education based on secondary research and document analysis (literature review), content analysis, and primary research (survey). As referent points for this research, multiple academic, scientific, and commercial sources were used to obtain a broader picture of the research subject. Furthermore, the survey was implemented among students in the Republic of Serbia, with 103 respondents to generate data and information on how much knowledge of AI and ML is held by the student population, mainly to understand both opportunities and challenges involved in AI and ML in HEI. The study addresses critical issues, like common knowledge and stance of research bases regarding AI and ML in HEI; best practices regarding usage of AI and ML in HEI; students’ knowledge of AI and ML; and students’ attitudes regarding AI and ML opportunities and challenges in HEI. In statistical considerations, aiming to evaluate if the indicators were considered reflexive and, in this case, belong to the same theoretical dimension, the Correlation Matrix was presented, followed by the Composite Reliability. Finally, the results were evalu-ated by regression analysis. The results indicated that AI and ML are essential technologies that enhance learning, primarily through students’ skills, collaborative learning in HEI, and an accessible research environment. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluating the prospects for university-based ethical governance in artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation
AU  - Hine, C.
T2  - Research Ethics
AB  - There has been considerable debate around the ethical issues raised by data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence. Ethical principles for the field have focused on the need to ensure that such technologies are used for good rather than harm, that they enshrine principles of social justice and fairness, that they protect privacy, respect human autonomy and are open to scrutiny. While development of such principles is well advanced, there is as yet little consensus on the mechanisms appropriate for ethical governance in this field. This paper examines the prospects for the university ethics committee to undertake effective review of research conducted on data-driven technologies in the university context. Challenges identified include: the relatively narrow focus of university-based ethical review on the human subjects research process and lack of capacity to anticipate downstream impacts; the difficulties of accommodating the complex interplay of academic and commercial interests in the field; and the need to ensure appropriate expertise from both specialists and lay voices. Overall, the challenges identified sharpen appreciation of the need to encourage a joined-up and effective system of ethical governance that fosters an ethical culture rather than replacing ethical reflection with bureaucracy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning approach that analyzes student assessment scores across a teaching period to predict their final exam performance. One challenge for many universities around the world is identifying the students who are at risk of failing a subject sufficiently early enough to provide proactive interventions that aim to minimize the risk of failure due to several reasons such as the volume of (big) data. We propose a data-driven strategy using machine learning, an application of artificial intelligence that has become popular for extracting knowledge from data by combining strategies and processes from statistics and computer science. By being able to predict what a student’s exam performance is ahead of time, interventions can occur, and students can be provided with extra support from their teachers to aid them in achieving the best result possible. In this research, we collected data from a popular in-formation-technology subject at an Australian university and applied a machine-learning algorithm to the data to predict a few hundred students’ exam scores. We also developed a framework of learning-support activities that would be of most benefit to at-risk students to achieve maximum impact before their exam would be conducted. We discovered through our approach that we can accurately predict the bottom 20–30 percent of students at risk, enabling a large cohort of students to be helped through our intervention framework, which we believe can have a positive impact on their future results. © 2020 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.

AB  - Critical infrastructures which are crucial to our modern life such as electricity grids and water pumps are controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Over the last two decades connecting these critical infrastructures to the internet has become essential. This made SCADA security an increasingly important research topic. This paper copes with two challenges: (1) SCADA systems tend to repeat themselves within a well-defined time period; then a malicious attacker can change the duration time in which the system holds a certain value without changing the order of the activities, i.e., the order in which the values appear. (2) The malicious activity may affect the data payload of the communicated SCADA packets rather than the explicit defined function codes (W/R). To face these challenges we propose two machine learning algorithms. The first algorithm is supervised. It finds first frequent temporal patterns, then these patterns are recognized in the data payload of the SCADA communication protocols, and used as features for a classification algorithm. The second algorithm is unsupervised. It learns an automaton that represents the temporal behavior of the system. Then at runtime, unknown states or events are declared as malicious. Experimental evaluation on real MODUBS-SCADA dataset from Ben-Gurion University shows that the first supervised algorithm, that uses frequent temporal patterns as features, performs better than a baseline algorithm that considers the mean and standard deviation as features. The second unsupervised algorithm performs even better than the first one. © 2020

TI  - Can close cooperation between esp/clil experts and disciplinary teachers in higher education lead to fostering english education environment
AU  - Hurajová, Ľ.
T2  - Journal of Teaching English for Specific and Academic Purposes
AB  - Current challenges and issues are so complex that without a close, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation it is very difficult or even impossible to solve and find innovative approaches to them. We are living in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and also virtual reality which are changing the paradigm of all our living including education. As far as communication within multidisciplinary and multinational working teams is concerned, English has become a preferable language that is used worldwide including academia and research. In non-English speaking countries Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have faced very similar challenge how to foster establishing English Education Environment (EEE). Most of their students speak different language and their level of English competence differs. Likewise, disciplinary teachers’ (DTs’) English competence and readiness to teach their courses in English vary. This contribution describes the project (Visegrad+) of HEIs from Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Albania and Serbia, intended to study if Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and close cooperation between ESP/CLIL experts and DTs can result in effective English learning-teaching environment. The main project outcome – web platform for ESP/ CLIL and DTs communities is presented. Finally, as far as interdisciplinary teacher cooperation is concerned, some observations during COVID19 pandemic are illustrated. © 2021 by University of Niš, Serbia | Creative Commons License: CC BY-NC-ND.

AU  - De Oliveira Fornasier, M.
T2  - Revista Opiniao Juridica
AB  - We sought to study the main reflexes of the digital economy that influence legal education, and some of the operational suggestions that accompany criticisms of that process. To this end, some of the main suggestions made by experts in law and education to transform legal education in the face of the technological ubiquity scenario were observed. In a second moment, the transformations that higher education has been undergoing with the introduction of AI in the market and in universities were specifically analyzed. Finally, both the reflexes of AI in legal education and suggestions related to transformations that legal education must undergo were studied. Methodology: The hypothetical-deductive procedure method was used, with a qualitative and technical approach of bibliographic-documentary research, in this exploratory and interdisciplinary research. Results: It was identified that legal education will have to move away from a retrospective epistemological stance, and evolve towards a prospective and projective stance, incorporating knowledge from technological areas and quantitative methodologies, without neglecting the exercise of traditional normative skills, communicative and narrative values that are highly evaluated by law professionals, thus emphasizing the need to foster student creativity. It is also concluded that higher education courses should incorporate coding in their curricula, in parallel with encouraging students' creativity and their communicative skills-however, a regulation should be developed in parallel, which must take into account the ethical risks of the use of AI in teaching. Finally, it is clear that the legal professions are not yet under a very pressing possibility of substitution by AI, but universities must make students aware that there are specific tasks in the legal professions that may be replaced by AI tools in order to advise them to focus on tasks that cannot be replaced by machines. © 2020 Centro Universitario Christus.

TI  - A Hybrid Deep ResNet and Inception Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification
AU  - Alotaibi, B.
AU  - Alotaibi, M.
T2  - PFG - Journal of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geoinformation Science
AB  - Over the past few decades, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has garnered increasing attention from the remote sensing research community. The largest challenge faced by HSI classification is the high feature dimensions represented by the different HSI bands given the limited number of labeled samples. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have been shown to be highly effective in several computer vision problems such as object detection and image classification. In terms of accuracy and computational cost, one of the best CNN architectures is the Inception model i.e., the winner of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) 2014 challenge. Another architecture that has significantly improved image recognition performance is the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture i.e., the winner of the ILSVRC 2015 challenge. Inspired by the incredible performance introduced by the Inception and ResNet architectures, we investigate the possibility of combining the core ideas of these two models into a hybrid architecture to improve the HSI classification performance. We tested this combined model on four standard HSI datasets, and it shows competitive results compared with other existing HSI classification methods. Our hybrid deep ResNet-Inception architecture obtained accuracies of 95.31% on the Pavia University dataset, 99.02% on the Pavia Centre scenes dataset, 95.33% on the Salinas dataset and 90.57% on the Indian Pines dataset. © 2020, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformation (DGPF) e.V.

T2  - Data and Policy
AB  - Internet and Communication Technology/electrical and electronic equipment (ICT/EEE) form the bedrock of today's knowledge economy. This increasingly interconnected web of products, processes, services, and infrastructure is often invisible to the user, as are the resource costs behind them. This ecosystem of machine-to-machine and cyber-physical-system technologies has a myriad of (in)direct impacts on the lithosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. As key determinants of tomorrow's digital world, academic institutions are critical sites for exploring ways to mitigate and/or eliminate negative impacts. This Report is a self-deliberation provoked by the question How do we create more resilient and healthier computer science departments: living laboratories for teaching and learning about resource-constrained computing, computation, and communication? Our response for University College London (UCL) Computer Science is to reflect on how, when, and where resources - energy, (raw) materials including water, space, and time - are consumed by the building (place), its occupants (people), and their activities (pedagogy). This perspective and attendant first-of-its-kind assessment outlines a roadmap and proposes high-level principles to aid our efforts, describing challenges and difficulties hindering quantification of the Department's resource footprint. Qualitatively, we find a need to rematerialise the ICT/EEE ecosystem: to reveal the full costs of the seemingly intangible information society by interrogating the entire life history of paraphernalia from smartphones through servers to underground/undersea cables; another approach is demonstrating the corporeality of commonplace phrases and Nature-inspired terms such as artificial intelligence, social media, Big Data, smart cities/farming, the Internet, the Cloud, and the Web. We sketch routes to realising three interlinked aims: cap annual power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, become a zero waste institution, and rejuvenate and (re)integrate the natural and built environments.  © The Author(s), 2020.

T2  - Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes
AB  - Purpose: Globally, higher education has been, over the years, a source of innovation, policy, new knowledge and a national asset. However, the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is having an impact on the principles of learning from primary to tertiary levels. The purpose of this paper is to consider how the 4IR has and will continue to impact education at the various levels of learning. Design/methodology/approach: The paper aims to bridge the perceived information gap and provide insights into the kinds of educational preparation and the skills and qualifications that 4IR jobs require. In response, the following are considered: the need to tweak the curriculum, adopt the right technology for in class and online delivery and the projection of other learning techniques and skills that are often not considered pertinent. Data gathering for the report was by discussion with experts and consultation of relevant articles and write-ups from related websites. Findings: The advent of smart communication systems involving artificial intelligence, internet, robotics, virtual reality and digital textbooks has opened a new vista in relation to how and what is learnt in schools. Just as technologies brought about smart communication systems, the 4IR model of higher education is rapidly evolving and as such, curriculum development and review must be dynamic, and it must keep pace with the technological advances and skills required in the twenty first century. Research limitations/implications: More purposeful research needs to be conducted in universities and industries with the intention of accelerating internal and external innovations so that markets can be expanded. Furthermore, efforts to reduce the cost and time of generating innovations will need to be intensified. Practical implications: The value and emphasis that are placed on the acquisition of degrees and paper qualifications are changing rapidly. Although it is traditional for students to compete for admission to the face-to-face classroom model, it is no longer unusual for a student to take courses online from any part of the world and still be accepted into positions usually reserved for traditional classroom education. Social implications: As at today, examples of 4IR services include Uber, Airbnb, Cloud services, Artificial intelligence, Cyber-security, three-dimensional printers, driverless cars and robotics. Machine learning and drone technology are also of growing significance. As yet, subjects dealing with such inventions and innovations are not part of the curriculum of many institutions and this is a cause for concern. Originality/value: The 4IR era will bring great changes to how students are taught and what students must learn as the tools for transformational learning are already overwhelming. Jobs will be scarce for those without the requisite skills, whereas those with the right skills will have to keep up with the pace of technological development, otherwise they too will be left behind. Schools will increasingly become centres for the generation of innovation and its incubation and in all this, quality learning, teaching and knowledge impartation can easily be carried out online. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Career guidance in the era of life-long learning faces challenges related to building accessible services that bridge education and employment services. So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support guidance across higher education and working life. This paper reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance in higher education institutions. Results from focus groups, scenario work and practical trials are presented, mapping requirements and possibilities for using artificial intelligence in career guidance from the viewpoints of students, guidance staff and institutions. The findings indicate potential value and functions as well as drivers and barriers for adopting artificial intelligence in career guidance to support higher education and life-long learning. The authors conceptualize different modes of agency and maturity levels for the involvement of artificial intelligence in guidance processes based on the results. Recommended future research topics in the area of artificially enhanced guidance services include agency in guidance interaction, developing guidance data ecosystem and ethical issues. © 2021, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown, and technologies have intensified across all fields of life, particularly in education. AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates’ skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions. In conclusion, the paper focuses on AI’s applications, benefits and sustainable development education challenges. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Aims The world hospital systems are presently facing many unprecedented challenges from COVID‐19 disease. Prediction the deteriorating or critical cases can help triage patients and assist in effective medical resource allocation. This study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model based on Machine Learning algorithms to predict hospitalized COVID-19 patients for transfer to ICU based on clinical parameters. Materials & Methods This retrospective, single-center study was conducted based on cumulative data of COVID-19 patients (N=1225) who were admitted from March 9, 2020, to December 20, 2020, to Mostafa Khomeini Hospital, affiliated to Ilam University of Medical Sciences (ILUMS), focal point center for COVID-19 care and treatment in Ilam, West of Iran. 13 ML techniques from six different groups applied to predict ICU admission. To evaluate the performances of models, the metrics derived from the confusion matrix were calculated. The algorithms were implemented using WEKA 3.8 software. Findings This retrospective study’s median age was 50.9 years, and 664 (54.2%) were male. The experimental results indicate that Meta algorithms have the best performance in ICU admission risk prediction with an accuracy of 90.37%, a sensitivity of 90.35%, precision of 88.25%, F-measure of 88.35%, and ROC of 91%. Conclusion Machine Learning algorithms are helpful predictive tools for real-time and accurate ICU risk prediction in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission. This model enables and potentially facilitates more responsive health systems that are beneficial to high-risk COVID-19 patients. © 2021, the Authors | Publishing Rights, ASPI.

AB  - Objective: To profile the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP), a population health data centre located at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Approach: We describe how MCHP was established and funded, and how it continues to operate based on a foundation of trust and respect between researchers at the University of Manitoba and stakeholders in the Manitoba Government's Department of Health. MCHP's research priorities are jointly determined by its scientists' own research interests and by questions put forward from Manitoba government ministries. Data governance, data privacy, data linkage processes and data access are discussed in detail. We also provide three illustrative examples of the MCHP Data Repository in action, demonstrating how studies using a variety of Repository datasets have had an impact on health and social policies and programs in Manitoba.

TI  - Theorising machine learning as an alternative pathway for higher education in Africa
AU  - Fomunyam, K.G.
T2  - International Journal of Education and Practice
AB  - Machine learning technology is currently a new frontier for higher education globally, and the African higher education system needs to change in tandem with this technological trend in order to combat challenges faced by the system. These challenges include lack of institutional research to discover new knowledge, unfavorable methods of instruction, especially the language conflict, access to education for marginalized and isolated communities, high dropout rates, depleted infrastructure and unavailability of resources, overpopulated classrooms, and a biased grading system. This paper discusses alternative machine learning solutions to these challenges faced by the African higher education system, in order to ensure that students develop the skills needed to thrive in this digital era. Findings reveal three key technological solutions that can provide alternative solutions to these challenges, and they include customized/personalized learning, predictive analytics and digital administrative management, and virtual assistance. This paper concludes that for Africa, Catching up with the world goes beyond adopting these new innovations to facilitate learning. Recommendations include rethinking the content of the African curriculum, developing an unbiased education system, and adopting a suitable medium of instruction. © 2020 Conscientia Beam.

TI  - Artificial intelligence aided engineering education: State of the art, potentials and challenges
AU  - Martín Núñez, J.L.
AU  - Lantada, A.D.
T2  - International Journal of Engineering Education
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is already starting to transform the way engineering systems are conceived, designed and managed, helping to maximize the chances of successfully achieving their goals. Engineering science, technology and research clearly benefit from AI and engineering educators should be able to make students aware of its potentials, teach them the necessary fundamentals of this field of study and guide them through the application of these algorithms and technologies to the development of real engineering projects, as necessary aspects in modern engineering programmes of study. However, the more relevant impact of artificial intelligence in engineering education goes beyond the application of a set of novel resources to solving specific engineering problems: In fact, the concept of ‘‘artificial intelligence-aided engineering education’’ refers to utilizing artificial intelligence techniques and resources for improving the teaching-learning process in higher education, especially in connection with scientific-technological studies. In this study, we concentrate on how AI techniques can support the teaching-learning process in engineering and we describe how AI can be swiftly introduced into any engineering programme. We also analyze the potential impact of AI on improving the overall operation of universities, as extremely complex systems managing myriads of data and countless processes and interactions. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.

The explosive growth of GenAI in design practice demands that design educators ensure students are prepared to enter the design profession with the knowledge and experience of using GenAI. To facilitate GenAI's introduction in a project-based context, it is suggested that design educators use critical engagement as a starting point to assure students understand the strengths and weakness of GenAI in the creative design process. There is little guidance on how to systematically integrate GenAI in design studio practice while maintaining a critical perspective of the ethical issues it has engendered. This research explores student attitudes toward GenAI, frequency of its use, and student perception of its impact on their future design careers.

AU  - Craft, Bruce A.
T2  - Research Issues in Contemporary Education
AB  - This paper addresses the pedagogical implications of incorporating ChatGPT into the college English classroom specifically and, more broadly, into any college course with a focus on writing and research. Historically, advances in technology in the college classroom have characteristically promoted two juxtaposed reactions: relief and anxiety. Students customarily exhibit relief that a new technology will lessen their workload and embrace it wholeheartedly. Conversely, faculty often experience anxiety at how some newfangled computerized application will impact student learning. This juxtaposition creates barriers to an effective integration of new technology into the classroom. What students view as a cool new tool faculty see as a platform that promotes student slacking or, at worst, cheating. Such is the case with ChatGPT.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: Educators are raising ethical concerns over the use of ChatGPT in schools. They have implemented various strategies to minimize its use, particularly by labeling ChatGPT-produced work as plagiarism. However, the use of ChatGPT among students is still on the rise. Our study aims to find the behavioral motivation behind students' increased use of ChatGPT. Design/methodology/approach: We use PLS-SEM to analyze survey responses from 250 participants in a liberal arts university in the USA. Findings: Students' self-congruency influences their attitude and behavioral intention toward ChatGPT. Students use ChatGPT because they find a higher similarity between their personality and the persona depicted by ChatGPT. So, educators must consider creative assignments that cannot be solved using ChatGPT because any other deterrence will not minimize students' use of ChatGPT. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to incorporate students' behavioral moti

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant implications for higher education; however, references to AI in the literature are often vague and open to debate. In order to understand how to progress AI-related research and analysis, this critical review systematically searched top higher education journals for references to the term 'artificial intelligence'. We reviewed definitions and conducted a discourse analysis of included texts. Our findings identify few, confusing definitions and little overt reference to AI as a research object. We delineated two Discourses. The Discourse of imperative change outlines how AI is seen as an inevitable change to which all must respond. Additionally, the Discourse of altering authority describes how texts position AI as decentring the teacher and spreading authority across staff, machines, corporations and students. Our analysis prompts a call for new research foci that attend to the social implications of AI, including tracing accountability i

However, low teacher-to-student ratio makes it difficult for students to receive sufficient and personalized support that they might want to. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and conversational agents, such as chatbots, has provided opportunities for assisting learning for different types of students. This research aims at investigating the opportunities and requirements of chatbots as an intelligent helper to facilitate equity in learning. We developed a chatbot as an experimental platform to investigate the design opportunities of using chatbots to support inclusive learning. Through a chatbot-led user study with 215 undergraduate students, we found chatbots provide the opportunity to support students who are disadvantaged, with diverse life environments, and with varied learning styles. This could be achieved through an accessible, interactive, and confidential way.
