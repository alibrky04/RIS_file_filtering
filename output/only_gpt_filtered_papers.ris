T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into education, specifically through generative chatbots, can transform teaching and learning for education professionals in both administrative and pedagogical ways. However, the ethical implications of using generative chatbots in education must be carefully considered. Ethical concerns about advanced chatbots have yet to be explored in the education sector. This short article introduces the ethical concerns associated with introducing platforms such as ChatGPT in education. The article outlines how handling sensitive student data by chatbots presents significant privacy challenges, thus requiring adherence to data protection regulations, which may not always be possible. It highlights the risk of algorithmic bias in chatbots, which could perpetuate societal biases, which can be problematic. The article also examines the balance between fostering student autonomy in learning and the potential impact on academic self-efficacy, noting the risk of over-reliance on AI for educational purposes. Plagiarism continues to emerge as a critical ethical concern, with AI-generated content threatening academic integrity. The article advocates for comprehensive measures to address these ethical issues, including clear policies, advanced plagiarism detection techniques, and innovative assessment methods. By addressing these ethical challenges, the article argues that educators, AI developers, policymakers, and students can fully harness the potential of chatbots in education, creating a more inclusive, empowering, and ethically sound educational future.

T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - This survey study aims to understand how college students use and perceive artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It reports students' use, perceived motivations, and ethical concerns and how these variables are interrelated. Responses (n = 822) were collected from seven universities in five UAE emirates. The findings show widespread use of AI tools (79.6%), with various factors affecting students' perceptions about AI tools. Students also raised concerns about the lack of guidance on using AI tools. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed the underlining psychological mechanisms pertaining to AI tool adoption: perceived benefits fully mediated the relationship between AI knowledge and usefulness perceptions, peer pressure mediated the relationship between academic stress and AI adoption intent, and ethical concerns fully mediated the relationship between ethical perceptions and support for institutional AI regulations. The findings of this study provide implications for the opportunities and challenges posed by AI tools in higher education. This study is one of the first to provide empirical insights into UAE college students' use of AI tools, examining mediation models to explore the complexity of their motivations, ethical concerns, and institutional guidance. Ultimately, this study offers empirical data to higher education institutions and policymakers on student perspectives of AI tools in the UAE.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study explores the role of perceived utility, social influence, and ethical concerns in the adoption of AI-based data analysis tools among academic researchers in China, focusing on differences between public and private universities. The research aims to identify key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of AI technology in academic settings. A quantitative approach was employed, using a multi-group structural equation model (SEM) analysis to assess data collected from 750 academic researchers across various disciplines (N-pvt = 402; N-pub = 348). The findings reveal that both perceived utility and social influence significantly influence the adoption of AI tools. Higher perceived utility and stronger social influence lead to greater adoption. However, ethical concerns were found to moderate these relationships, particularly in public universities, where researchers with high ethical concerns perceived greater risks, thereby reducing their likelihood of adoption. In contrast, private university researchers showed a higher tolerance for perceived risks when utility and social influence were evident. The study's implications suggest that to promote AI adoption, institutions must address ethical concerns and perceived risks, particularly in public universities, by enhancing transparency, providing ethical guidelines, and offering comprehensive training. These efforts can lead to more effective integration of AI technologies, ultimately enhancing research productivity and innovation across diverse academic environments.

AU  - Ou, AW

AU  - Malmström, H
T2  - SYSTEM
AB  - AI -powered language tools (AILTs) are commonly used by university students, yet there is a limited understanding of how students utilise and perceive these tools in everyday academic communication practice. Employing a post -humanist lens and based on over 1700 open-ended comments from a nationwide student survey, this qualitative study examined students' lived AILT experiences to explicate the impact of AILTs on academic communication in higher education learning and assessment. Thematic analysis of the data shows that students' academic writing is realised by assemblages of distributed spatial and personal linguistic repertoires, underscoring AILT's role in enhancing students' communicative performance and personal language development. AILTs are also conducive to transforming the academic writing process into an additional learning space. Students have developed a new identity as spatially advised learners, enabling them to assert their agency in terms of language development and subjectcontent knowledge while also holding critical perspectives on the limitations of AI. Furthermore, the findings point to divergent and eclectic student viewpoints on the ethical concerns of AILTs in assessment in the absence of university instructions. The study discusses implications for university policymaking and pedagogy in developing teaching and assessment methods that match students' stances and needs in AI -mediated academic communication.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online assessment, prompting debates over validity, security, and increasingly the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, especially generative AI, on traditional examination methods. This paper explores perceptions of the evolving landscape of online assessment and the role of AI within higher education, building on work conducted at the University of London and the Open University UK. Workshops used speculative methods to envision potential future scenarios and gather perspectives. These revealed a complex, ambivalent outlook on online assessment and AI's role in education. The paper highlights the polarised views surrounding AI, ranging from ethical concerns about academic integrity and unfair advantages to opportunities for enhancing learning and inclusivity in assessment practices. Our findings reflect attitudes of students and educators towards AI and online assessment, identifying key themes such as ethics and integrity, the need for redesigning assessments, issues of diversity and inclusion, and the dependencies required for successful integration of AI. Participants highlighted both the potential benefits of AI in creating more authentic and personalised assessment experiences and the risks of exacerbating inequalities and undermining institutional credibility. The paper underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach to AI and online assessment in educational policy and practice, emphasising inclusive, ethical, and innovative approaches to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these technological disruptors.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools hold significant promises for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. However, continues usage behavior and satisfaction of educators with GenAI systems are still less explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors influencing academic staff satisfaction and continuous GenAI usage in higher education, employing a survey method and analyzing data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This research utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) as its theoretical foundations, while also integrating ethical concerns as a significant factor. Data was collected from a sample of 127 university academic staff through an online survey questionnaire. The study found a positive correlation between effort expectancy, ethical consideration, expectation confirmation, and academic staff satisfaction. However, performance expectancy did not show a positive correlation with satisfaction. Performance expectancy was positively related to the intention to use GenAI tools, while academic staff satisfaction positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The social influence did not correlate positively with the use of GenAI. Security and privacy were positively associated with staff satisfaction. Facilitation conditions also positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for academia and policymakers, guiding the responsible integration of GenAI tools in education while emphasizing factors for policy considerations and developers of GenAI tools.

AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, has transformed educational landscapes globally. Moreover, the Beijing Consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education and the 'Pact for the Future' propose that AI can support UNESCO in achieving development goals, especially focusing on SDG 4, which emphasizes quality education. Thus, this study investigates undergraduate students' familiarity with and attitudes toward AI tools, as well as their perceived risks and benefits of using AI tools at a private university in China. An explanatory sequential mixed-method design was employed with an online survey of 167 students, followed by a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses. Data were analyzed using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test and thematic analysis, supported by SPSS and ATLAS.ti 25. The findings revealed that students demonstrated moderate familiarity with AI tools, particularly ChatGPT and willingness to use them in coursework. Positive attitudes toward AI's value in education were evident, although concerns such as dependence and reduced independent thinking, algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, accuracy and information quality, data security, and privacy concerns were observed among students. Moreover, students generally viewed AI positively and perceived AI integration as inevitable and becoming common in academic settings. Students were concerned that the misuse of AI by their teachers was minimal and trusted their teachers to use AI effectively in teaching. Students also perceived AI's benefits, such as personalized learning, efficiency and convenience, career and skill development, and support for independent learning. This study contributes to the discourse on AI integration in higher education by highlighting students' nuanced perceptions and balancing their benefits with potential risks. The findings of this study were limited by the small sample size and institution. Future research should explore diverse contexts to develop comprehensive AI implementation frameworks for higher education.

AU  - Gallent-Torres, C

AU  - Ortego-Hernando, JL
T2  - RELIEVE-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y EVALUACION EDUCATIVA
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized the field of higher education, and sparked debates on the potential of tools such as ChatGPT, Humata.ai or Sudowrite in teaching, learning and assessment processes. While their integration in this context offers numerous opportunities ( e.g., instant feedback, generation of resources and teaching materials, adaptive learning, interactivity, etc.), it also poses significant challenges that raise ethical and academic integrity concerns, such as the reliability of information, transparency regarding the sources used, or data privacy and security. The aim of this article is to examine the ethical implications of GAI in higher education from a three-fold perspective (students, faculty, and institutions). Additionally, it aims to analyze its impact on aspects related to security, accessibility, sustainability and even new forms of plagiarism and academic fraud that involve impersonation of authorship. Based on the literature review conducted, and in accordance with the ideas proposed by some authors, possibilities for integrating GAI into university classrooms will be explored. This will be achieved through pedagogical practices that guide students in the proper use of GAI and enable faculty to seek new educational approaches. This transformation process will require the establishment of clear guidelines that align with ethical codes and integrity policies of higher education institutions. Ultimately, the reflection on how to combine education, innovation, and academic integrity will provide these three groups with a new opportunity to drive improvements in university education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB  - The growing incidence of academic dishonesty (AD) involving students using commercial essay writing services (essay mills) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) risks the credibility of assessment approaches within higher education (HE) worldwide. Reflecting on experience from a UK business school, the article explores the potential for novel assessment design and feedback to reduce the prevalence of AD. Speculating on success and failure rates of students undertaking formal assessment, the article evaluates the broader ethical implications for universities in recruitment and learner support, particularly within contemporary discourses on international student attainment, mental health, and well-being.

T2  - AI APPROACHES TO LITERACY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) models become widespread, South African universities need policies that balance access and uphold standards. Literature shows generative AI offers opportunities like personalised support, but risks like plagiarism require addressing. Current university guidance focuses narrowly on misconduct, not innovation. Principles proposed for policies include recognising AI's value if governed well; developing inclusive policies through participation; regular updating as AI advances rapidly; effectively communicating policies; anticipating AI's impact across teaching, learning, research, and assessment; and partnering between universities and AI companies. Case studies show involving stakeholders is vital. Comprehensive policies outlining ethical use across contexts are lacking. Guidance tends to emphasise constraints, not possibilities. However, responsible leveraging can expand access without compromising literacy development. This needs evidence-based governance upholding enduring educational values amid emerging tools.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Introduction The study investigates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) and its impact on pre-service teachers at the University of Latvia (UL) by exploring pre-service teachers' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of AI in both their academic learning and their future professional roles as educators, particularly regarding the promotion of inclusive education.Methods Data was collected via an online survey of 240 pre-service teachers across various disciplines at the UL. The survey included demographic details, AI usage patterns, and perceived benefits and challenges. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Spearman's correlation, and thematic analysis.Results Less than half of the participants used AI in their studies, with many expressing ambivalence or opposition toward AI. Benefits included language assistance and accessibility to global knowledge, while challenges involved reduced critical thinking and concerns over plagiarism. Despite recognizing AI's potential to promote inclusivity, most pre-service teachers have not applied it in practice. No significant differences in AI perceptions were found based on age, gender, or study level.Discussion The findings highlight a low adoption rate of AI among pre-service teachers and a gap between theoretical recognition of AI's potential and its practical application, particularly for inclusion. The study emphasizes the need for HE institutions to enhance AI literacy and readiness among future teachers.Conclusion AI is underutilized by pre-service teachers in both HE learning and teaching environments, which has implications for teacher preparation programs that better integrate AI literacy and inclusive practices.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - An open access article under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more widely used in higher education, we must pay attention to the risks that can emerge. AI projects, whether applied in classroom learning or used for decision-making regarding admissions, financial aid allocation, or hiring, must include attention to governance and compliance issues, regardless of the project's scope and scale. Concerns highlighted in this work include transparency, user privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability, however, we note that this is a non-exhaustive list of risks. In this paper, risk assessment is defined, and two examples of risk management frameworks, namely the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework and the non-profit humanitarian effort ForHumanity's Independent Audit of AI, Algorithmic, and Autonomous Systems are briefly described. We identify characteristics of AI applications that need to be assessed for vulnerabilities they may present, such as bias and discrimination. This paper aims to facilitate discussion among stakeholders about the risks that may be encountered from using AI in higher education, as well as to suggest ways developers, decision-makers, and users can mitigate these risks. Much discussion and published literature has focused on risk management frameworks designed for large organizations or enterprises or frameworks that do not consider risks specific to AI. We hope that decision-makers carefully consider the risks, perform due diligence when implementing AI applications, and create a plan for mitigating the risks. This research supports e-learning practice because students and faculty are embracing AI applications. Leaders and decision-makers in higher education need to be proactive in protecting their varied stakeholders. The paper asks what risks may be encountered by institutions of higher education when using AI tools and products in the classroom and for various aspects of decision-making and if published frameworks can mitigate these risks.

AB  - AI offers new opportunities to facilitate sustainable development and the inclusion of all actors within this process, which starts with education and science that were massively influenced by AI during the pandemic COVID-19 because of the transition of all countries to the hybrid system of higher education. This paper deals with the ethics of AI and scientific research. Three points are discussed in this paper. First, AI opportunities and challenges related to higher education and scientific research. The second is the importance of the ethics of AI in higher education and scientific research, and the third point is the new strategies and policy actions needed to ensure social development. As is concluded in this paper, optimal actions are needed, especially new international and national mechanisms, rethinking public policies, and reinforcement of the investment in this field becomes thus an obligation rather than a choice.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB  - The increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in management curricula raises the need to integrate AI into assessment systems. For this purpose, this study used anxiety and resistance to change with an integrated variable, adoption readiness' to examine university teachers' attitudes towards AI-based assessment systems. We collected data from university teachers in social sciences and management disciplines from West Malaysia. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to determine the ability of the UTAUT model antecedent to the proposed method. After eliminating the distorting observed variable, this study used performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions as 'adoption readiness'. The results of path analysis indicated that (1) anxiety has a significant negative impact on adoption readiness and attitude of university teachers; (2) positive but insignificant impact of resistance to change on adoption readiness and attitude; (3) adoption readiness mediates the relationship between anxiety and attitude while; (4) no mediation role of adoption readiness was found between the relationship of resistance to change and attitude of the university teachers towards an AI-based assessment systems. This study significantly contributes to the existing pedagogical literature by synthesizing the UTAUT model's antecedents in a novel way to examine technology adoption readiness which further adds in the originality of this study.

T2  - INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This qualitative study explores the levels of technology acceptance of students and teachers in higher education regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in summative assessment. Twelve students and eight teachers of a university expressed their views on a series of hypothetical scenarios. Stimulated recall interviews, using hypothetical scenarios, were conducted with 12 of them, applying convenience sampling. Student and teacher views were aligned regarding technology's potential for efficiency and personalised feedback, while both groups underlined the need for explainability and trust, noting also that a teacher knows more about a student's learning trajectory than a submitted assignment could depict. Both groups also expressed concerns that reach beyond technology performance. For students, introducing AI for summative assessment could break the student-teacher connection, while for teachers such a step could take away opportunities for professional development, as grading is considered an essential skill for them.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-based tools are rapidly revolutionizing the field of higher education, yet to be explored in terms of their impact on existing higher education institutions' (HEIs) practices adopted for continuous learning improvement, given the sparsity of the literature and empirical experiments in undergraduate degree programs. After the entry of ChatGPT -a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses a deep learning model to generate human-like text response based on provided input-it has become crucial for HEIs to be exposed to the implications of AI-based tools on students' learning outcomes, commonly measured using an assessment-based approach to improve program quality, teaching effectiveness, and other learning support. An empirical study has been conducted to test the ChatGPT capability of solving a variety of assignments (from different level courses of undergraduate degree programs) to compare its performance with the highest scored student(s). Further, the ChatGPT-generated assignments were tested using the best-known tools for plagiarism detection to determine whether they could pass the academic integrity tests, including Turnitin, GPTZero, and Copyleaks. The study reported the limitations of the Bot and highlighted the implications of the newly launched AI-based ChatGPT in academia, which calls for HEIs' managers and regulators to revisit their existing practices used to monitor students' learning progress and improve their educational programs.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational institutions is part of a global trend shaped by the capabilities of this technology. However, due to the disruptive nature of AI technologies, it greatly affects the way of teaching and learning. It is therefore essential to establish clear guidelines that not only ensure that all competencies required by the curricula are still effectively taught, but also empower students to use the new technology in a productive manner. Developing such guidelines for emerging and dynamic technologies is a very challenging task, as rules often struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving advancements. The European Union found a good way to tackle this problem in its AI Act by introducing a risk-based approach to regulate AI applications of organizations. Depending on the level of risk, applications might be prohibited, require extensive analysis and safeguards, have transparency obligations, or need no further action. This paper adapts the core structure of the AI Act regulation for the education sector to provide teachers and students with a structured framework for dealing with AI. Various use cases, based on teaching and learning life cycles, are presented to illustrate the versatility of AI in teaching and the learning process. By establishing such a framework, we not only promote competence development in dealing with AI but also contribute to the creation of an ethical and responsible use of AI in education.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING EDUCATION
AB  - Marketing instructors increasingly are using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency in course planning and assessment. However, scholarship has yet to show how such use impacts student evaluations, which are often skewed by gender bias. Toward this aim, we conducted a quasi-experiment in which college-student participants viewed student work along with instructor feedback under four experimental conditions. In one condition, participants were told the grade and feedback were written by the instructor and, in another, that the feedback was generated by an AI tool trained by the instructor. Instructor gender was also manipulated. Participants evaluated the assessment and the instructor using measures of agency and competence. We found that perceptions of agency and competence were higher for male instructors than for female instructors who did not use an AI tool. However, when instructors used AI, marked reductions in gender differences occurred. These findings suggest that AI complicates perceptions of agency and competence enough to potentially level the playing field for female instructors. However, perceptions of instructors were universally more negative when participants were told the assessment was created with AI, regardless of instructor gender. Therefore, attempts to use AI as an assessment tool should be made with caution.

AU  - Verano-Tacoronte, D
AU  - Bolívar-Cruz, A
AU  - Sosa-Cabrera, S
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study investigates the role of technology-related anxiety in shaping university teachers' behavioral intention to adopt ChatGPT. Three distinct types of anxiety are examined: (a) anxiety about the future of the academic profession, (b) anxiety regarding the personal misuse of ChatGPT, and (c) anxiety concerning negative impacts on student learning. A structured questionnaire was administered to 249 faculty members from Spanish public universities. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess both the direct effects of each type of anxiety on behavioral intention and the mediating roles of effort expectancy (EE) and performance expectancy (PE). Results indicate that anxiety about student learning exhibits a significant negative direct effect on behavioral intention and an indirect effect through performance expectancy. Similarly, anxiety related to the misuse of ChatGPT is negatively associated with behavioral intention, with significant mediation through both EE and PE. In contrast, anxiety concerning the future of the academic profession does not show a statistically significant relationship with behavioral intention. The findings underscore the importance of addressing specific psychological barriers-particularly those linked to concerns over student learning and technology misuse-to facilitate ChatGPT integration in higher education. The study suggests that effective implementation strategies should combine technical training with targeted interventions aimed at managing technology-related anxiety, enhancing ethical practices, and improving perceptions of the tool's utility and ease of use.

AB  - ChatGPT, as an example of generative artificial intelligence, possesses high-level conversational and problem-solving capabilities supported by powerful computational models and big data. However, the powerful performance of ChatGPT might enhance learner dependency. Although it has not yet been confirmed, many teachers and scholars are also concerned about this issue. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate this topic further. This study's objective is to explore the association between inert thinking, positive experiences with ChatGPT, avoidance learning motivation, and ChatGPT dependence, based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model. Employing a cross-sectional design, we conducted an online survey with 870 Taiwanese university students, who had an average age of 22.81 years. The study found that inert thinking was positively associated with both positive experiences with ChatGPT and ChatGPT dependence. Furthermore, a significant association was found between inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation. Positive experience with ChatGPT was also positively related to avoidance learning motivation and ChatGPT dependence. Due to the scarcity of empirical research on generative artificial intelligence, the issues that people worry about when discussing AI were confirmed in this study. Moreover, avoidance learning motivation was positively correlated with ChatGPT dependence. Based on these findings, this study calls for educators to help students overcome inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation to prevent dependency on emerging technologies.

AB  - We are currently witnessing a global increase in the provision of software platforms and services, offered at << no cost >> by large corporations, to higher education. The business model behind these services is largely based on the collection and analysis of massive quantities of user data and metadata, collected through educational packages, which include e-mail, video-conferencing, groupware, file sharing, and other integrated services. The penetration of these services in higher education worldwide is largely unknown. In this study we discuss a methodology and a software script developed to collected new data for all 448 public higher education institutions in all 13 countries in South America. The data show that for every ten higher education institutions in the region, eight have services and platforms offered by such businesses. We contend that the adoption of these services is largely due to disinvestment in public education, and threaten the operational autonomy of institutions in regards to research and teaching, while leading to concerns in regards to data control, privacy, and transparency for teachers, administrators and students.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - Given the recent emergence of artificial intelligence as an important topic that can contribute to improve curricula and lecture delivery, an increasing number of scholars are investigating its impact in various educational fields. The ChatGPT, which is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement in the generative artificial intelligence area. Since its announcement, integrating the ChatGPT into computer programming curricula- and into other scientific curricula- has yielded some challenges. The main challenge is clearly evident in the conduct of in-class tests and in- lab assignments, where the students are given specific tasks to be accomplished within a certain time frame. As they might seek help from ChatGPT, these types of assessments could be considered a potential threat to academic integrity and may be viewed as a form of academic dishonesty. This study aims at integrating ChatGPT into computer programming curricula, exploring its potential to enhance undergraduate education. It follows a mixed methods approach to examine the potential integration of ChatGPT in teaching computer programming as a supplementary tool. A quasi-experimental design is followed, in which an experimental group is allowed to use ChatGPT and compared to a control group that was not. A research sample of 26 undergraduate students (13 males, 13 females) from the College of Education at Sultan Qaboos University participated in the study. The methodology encompassed three research instruments: in-class exams, in-lab assignments, and semi- structured interviews. These research instruments were utilized to assess the impact of ChatGPT on students' academic performance, which served as both independent (use of ChatGPT) and dependent (student performance) variables. The quantitative analysis revealed a significant enhancement in students' performance, while the qualitative analysis of semi- structured interviews indicated that participants view ChatGPT as a valuable support for learning. Feedback from participants suggested combining ChatGPT with traditional teaching methods to optimize learning outcomes. This study highlights the feasibility and educational benefits of incorporating AI tools like ChatGPT into teaching methodologies. It suggests that such integration can provide a more engaging and effective learning environment, potentially revolutionizing computer programming education. This paper supports e-learning practice by integrating AI-driven tools like ChatGPT into the educational framework and advances the e-learning area by demonstrating these technologies' potential to improve student academic performance in the learning environments. However, the study also acknowledges the need for further research to explore the long-term effects of AI integration in educational settings and to address any emerging challenges. These findings propose a promising direction for future curricular enhancements and suggest an effective method for the integration of AI technologies to support and enrich traditional educational frameworks.

AB  - Administrative burden in education is a serious issue for disabled students. Form-filling and bureaucracy are ubiquitous in further and higher education, particularly for students who need to disclose a disability and arrange for accommodations and support for an equitable educational experience. Paradoxically, many of these processes are inherently inaccessible for disabled students, and yet completing them can be critical to their success. Artificial Intelligence has potential to alleviate some of the burden imposed by administration and bureaucracy; virtual assistants and chatbots can replace forms with dialogue, without placing additional strain on institutions. However, it is essential that solutions are designed in partnership with disabled students to ensure that students' needs are met, their concerns addressed, and the final solution is equitable for them. This paper explores a case study of participatory research with disabled students in a large UK distance learning institution, in which participatory research identified an issue of administrative burden for disabled students, and a virtual assistant was designed as a solution using participatory design. It shares the methodology and design process, explores findings from different phases of the research, and shares recurrent themes arising throughout the study. In doing so, it aims to provide a foundation for future participatory research to reduce barriers for disabled students.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Peer assessment has been recognised as a sustainable and scalable assessment method that promotes higher-order learning and provides students with fast and detailed feedback on their work. Despite these benefits, some common concerns and criticisms are associated with the use of peer assessments (eg, scarcity of high-quality feedback from peer student-assessors and lack of accuracy in assigning a grade to the assessee) that raise questions about their trustworthiness. Consequently, many instructors and educational institutions have been anxious about incorporating peer assessment into their teaching. This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on how AI and learning analytics may be incorporated to address some of the common concerns associated with peer assessment systems, which in turn can increase their trustworthiness and adoption. In particular, we present and evaluate our AI-assisted and analytical approaches that aim to (1) offer guidelines and assistance to student-assessors during individual reviews to provide better feedback, (2) integrate probabilistic and text analysis inference models to improve the accuracy of the assigned grades, (3) develop feedback on reviews strategies that enable peer assessors to review the work of each other, and (4) employ a spot-checking mechanism to assist instructors in optimally overseeing the peer assessment process.

T2  - INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - The launch of OpenAI ChatGPT's language-generation model has raised alarms within many sectors, especially the academic sector. Several academicians have urged universities to develop new forms of assessment after the launch of ChatGPT, which solves academic questions in less than a few minutes. Academic cheating is not a new phenomenon, and the use of AI-generated text to cheat on assignments is a new type of cheating that poses unique challenges. This study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for topic modeling and the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) method for sentiment analysis. After data preprocessing, 3870 tweets were still available out of the originally 10,000 tweets that were extracted for the study. The VADER sentiment analysis results revealed that 2013 tweets were categorized as "positive," with the remaining 804 and 1053 tweets categorized as "negative" and "neutral." The analysis's findings indicate that the majority of people have favorable things to say about ChatGPT. As a result, educational institutions can mitigate the disruptive effects of this technology and promote academic integrity by developing clear policies and guidelines and designing assessments that include limited AI-generated text.

AU  - Salam, U
T2  - COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOLS
AB  - This study examines the integration of ChatGPT into English language learning by exploring students' experiences of using ChatGPT during the writing process. Adopting a convergent mixed-method design, the research involved students enrolled in the ICT for ELT course at a university in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, and applied the Technology Acceptance Model to explore the relationships among key variables. Ninety-five English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students participated in a four-week take-home assignment using a writing prompt provided by their lecturer. Qualitative data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire, which revealed that students' acceptance of ChatGPT was attributed to its user-friendly interface and ability to interact in their native language. Path analysis revealed that perceived ease of use positively influenced both perceived usefulness and attitude toward change, while perceived usefulness also positively affected attitude toward change. In turn, a positive attitude toward changes significantly impacted students' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT. Integrating qualitative and quantitative findings, this study suggests that ChatGPT fostered a positive attitude toward technological change and encouraged students to adopt it more frequently. Notably, students primarily used ChatGPT as a writing aid rather than for generating complete essays, suggesting the potential for using ChatGPT under instructor supervision to diminish risks of dishonesty in academic writing.

AB  - Introduction Building upon previous research, this study aims to provide answers to the questions of how the presence of a humanoid artificial pedagogical agent as teacher and instructor and visual self-other representation of the learners through avatars influence the immediate cognitive performance and learning experience in online learning among adult learners.Methods Several outcome measures were investigated to evaluate if effects are the same or different for the different experimental conditions and if learning with the pedagogical agent and visual self-other representation is modulated by the learner's previous experiences with and preferences for online learning. Teacher presence and self-other presence of the learners were experimentally manipulated. A humanoid artificial agent, visible on all of the slides of the online course material and instructing the material represented the teacher. The avatars of the learners (self-avatar and peer avatars) were kept of minimal functionality but self-avatars were preselected or could be self-selected by the learners. The learner's cognitive learning performance, the learner's attention to the pedagogical agent, their sense of teacher presence and of self- and other-presence, their satisfaction with the course as well as the learner's previous learning experiences were measured by cognitive testing, self-report, and linguistic analysis as major performance indicators and a positive learning experience. The analysis comprised 133 university students and results were additionally compared for two subsamples.Results Learning performance, learning satisfaction, and the attention paid to the teacher were positively related. In addition, positive evaluations of the cognitive presence elicited by the teacher were found. Self- or other-presence of avatars did not significantly influence the learner's performance beyond teacher presence but the learner's perception of it and their motivation to study online.Discussion The study and its results extend the previous literature that focused on the effects of pedagogical agents in online teaching or on virtual representations of the learner's self and classmates in online learning. Despite limitations, the results of this study provide insights into combining teaching with artificial pedagogical agents and visual avatars for self-other representation during online teaching and the observations can serve as catalyst for future research.

T2  - Advances in physiology education
AB  - Freely accessible generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) poses challenges to physiology education regarding learning and academic integrity. Although many studies have explored the capabilities of GenAI to complete assessments, few have implemented educative activities to highlight GenAI risks and benefits or explored physiology students' perceptions and uses of GenAI. Our study implemented a learning activity, designed using constructivist principles, to allow physiology students to explore GenAI and consider its use in assessment tasks. The activity engaged students (n = 236) enrolled in a second-year physiology subject over 2 years. The activity began with students being directed to critique a sample exam answer as a form of content revision. The answer had been covertly generated by ChatGPT, and it lacked depth and contained some hallucinated facts. Students then engaged in discussion about the use of GenAI for university study and assessment. Questions were used to stimulate thought and discussion, and student responses were collected via Padlet (492 posts). Thematic analysis of the comments highlighted students' beliefs about using GenAI and perceived benefits and risks. There was a general trend of increasing acceptance of using GenAI, and using it for assessment, over time. Students were concerned about breaching academic integrity guidelines, information accuracy and sources, and the negative effect it might have on their learning. At the conclusion of the activity, the revelation that ChatGPT wrote the sample exam answer reinforced the need for responsible GenAI use.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Constructivist learning tenets were used to guide the design of a critical evaluation learning activity about GenAI, to enable physiology students to make informed decisions regarding the use of GenAI in their learning and assessment. The trend of increasing acceptance of GenAI coincided with increasing student beliefs about uses of GenAI being perceived as responsible. Student concerns about academic integrity and ethical considerations persisted, yet academic misconduct cases increased.

AB  - Integrating generative AI (GAI) into higher education is crucial for preparing a future generation of GAI-literate students. However, a comprehensive understanding of global institutional adoption policies remains absent, with most prior studies focusing on the Global North and lacking a theoretical lens. This study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to examine GAI adoption strategies in higher education across 40 universities from six global regions. It explores the characteristics of GAI innovation, including compatibility, trialability, and observability, and analyses the communication channels and roles and responsibilities outlined in university policies and guidelines. The findings reveal that universities are proactively addressing GAI integration by emphasising academic integrity, enhancing teaching and learning practices, and promoting equity. Key policy measures include the development of guidelines for ethical GAI use, the design of authentic assessments to mitigate misuse, and the provision of training programs for faculty and students to foster GAI literacy. Despite these efforts, gaps remain in comprehensive policy frameworks, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns and ensuring equitable access to GAI tools. The study underscores the importance of clear communication channels, stakeholder collaboration, and ongoing evaluation to support effective GAI adoption. These insights provide actionable insights for policymakers to craft inclusive, transparent, and adaptive strategies for integrating GAI into higher education. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Written assignments for large classes pose a far more significant challenge in the age of the GenAI revolution. Suggestions such as oral exams and formative assessments are not always feasible with many students in a class. Therefore, we conducted a study in South Africa and involved 280 Honors students to explore the usefulness of Turnitin's AI detector in conjunction with student self-reflection. Using a Mixed Methods Research (MMR) approach, we analysed data generated from the Turnitin AI reports, our grading rubrics, and qualitative student self-reflection. The findings show that incorporating self-reflection into assessments supports ethical GenAI use and improves the transparency lecturers need for decision-making. A declaration form allowed the students to be upfront about using Generative Artificial Intelligence tools. We found that students who can reflect on their learning relied less on generated content. However, students with high AI detected scores (> 20%) did not adequately reflect on how the tools supported their learning and could not give credible explanations of use. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing students and academics with examples of responsibly handling AI-detected scores in large-class settings. We present a guided self-reflection and declaration with an AI detector to support students and help lecturers make decisions when grading. We also present a decision tree that lecturers and graders can use when evaluating AI use in assessments. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in higher education, widely adopted by both students and faculty for tasks ranging from writing to coding. Despite its growing usage, concerns over academic integrity and its long-term impact on learning persist. While educational institutions are developing policies to guide responsible Gen AI use, these measures often fail to prepare students for the realities of workplace applications. This qualitative study explores the gap between academic and professional usage of Gen AI through structured interviews with two groups: 20 faculty members and 20 industry professionals. Descriptive analysis of the data revealed a significant disconnect between pedagogical and industry practices, potentially leaving students underprepared for workplace demands. Faculty noted Gen AI's ability to assist in course-specific assignments but expressed concerns about over-reliance and ethical implications. Industry professionals emphasized its role in increasing efficiency through technical documentation, data processing, and decision-making, while identifying challenges like data security and ethical use. To address these issues, the study recommends a systemic approach that integrates hands-on Gen AI training, ethical instruction, and industry-aligned curricula into higher education. This approach includes embedding AI education into general education requirements and faculty development programs to ensure comprehensive preparedness. Additionally, collaborative projects, internships, and strategic partnerships with industry and accrediting bodies are essential to aligning curricula with workforce demands. Together, these efforts can equip students with the technical skills and ethical awareness needed to navigate and contribute effectively to AI-driven workplaces. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - This research explores postgraduate students' attitudes and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in academic writing, using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Guided by the mixed method approach, quantitative and qualitative measures like questionnaires and interviews were adopted to gather data from postgraduate students. Descriptive statistical tools like frequencies, means and SD were used to analyze responses from 339 postgraduate students, focusing on the perceived usefulness and actual usage of AI tools in their writing endeavors. The findings, presented through means and standard deviations, indicate an overall positive attitude towards AI tools. The students perceive AI as beneficial for improving grammar, preventing plagiarism, generating ideas, and enhancing overall writing proficiency. However, a lack of consensus is evident, with varied responses and inflated standard deviations suggesting differing opinions among respondents. Subjective norms play a crucial role in influencing students' decisions to use AI tools. Friends, colleagues, and lecturers significantly influence their perception and adoption of AI tools in academic writing. Although cautioned about excessive reliance, the influence of positive testimonials contributes to the widespread adoption of AI tools among postgraduate students. In terms of actual usage, the study reveals that postgraduate students frequently employ AI tools, primarily for idea development, spelling checks, paraphrasing, coherence, and searching for relevant literature. While some students appreciate the convenience and time-saving aspects of AI, others express concerns about potential detrimental effects on critical thinking and creativity. In conclusion, the research underscores the varied attitudes and usage patterns of postgraduate students regarding AI tools in academic writing. While many acknowledge the benefits, caution is advised to prevent overdependence and preserve critical thinking skills. The findings contribute valuable insights for educators and institutions seeking to integrate AI tools effectively into postgraduate education. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Introduction: The introduction highlights the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on higher education (HE), emphasising its potential to enhance student learning and instructor efficiency while also addressing significant challenges such as accuracy, privacy, and ethical concerns. By exploring the benefits and risks of AI integration, the introduction underscores the urgent need for evidence-based, inclusive, and adaptable frameworks to guide universities in leveraging GenAI responsibly and effectively in academic environments. Aims: This paper presents a comprehensive process for developing cross-disciplinary and consensus-based guidelines, based on the latest evidence for the integration of GenAI at European University Cyprus (EUC). In response to the rapid adoption of AI tools such as LLMs in HE, a task group at EUC created a structured framework to guide the ethical and effective use of GenAI in academia, one that was intended to be flexible enough to incorporate new developments and not infringe on instructors' academic freedoms, while also addressing ethical and practical concerns. Results: The framework development was informed by extensive literature reviews and consultations. Key pillars of the framework include: addressing the risks and opportunities presented by GenAI; promoting transparent communication; ensuring responsible use by students and educators; safeguarding academic integrity. The guidelines emphasise the balance between, on the one hand, leveraging AI to enhance educational experiences, and, on the other maintaining critical thinking and originality. The framework also includes practical recommendations for AI usage, classroom integration, and policy formulation, ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces human judgement in educational settings. Conclusions: The iterative development process, including the use of GenAI tools for refining the guidelines, illustrates a hands-on approach to AI adoption in HE, and the resulting guidelines may serve as a model for other higher education institutions (HEIs) aiming to integrate AI tools while upholding educational quality and ethical standards. © 2025 The Author(s).

TAM constructs: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Subjective Norms (SN), Attitude Towards Technology Use (ATU), Behavioral Intention (BI), and User Behavior (UB) were assessed. We also assessed perceptions of ethical use (EU) and student learning outcomes (SLO) using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. A measurement model had good fit indices and validated most hypotheses. A path analysis (PA) for hypothesized relationships suggested PEU and SN are significant predictors of BI and UB, whereas PU's influence on BI was indirect. Significantly, EU concerns negatively moderated the relationship between BI and UB, suggesting that higher ethical concerns can reduce ChatGPT usage. Cross-cultural analysis uncovered significant differences in perceptions and usage patterns influenced by institutional policies, academic levels, and demographic factors. Our findings affirm TAM's robustness in predicting technology use across various cultural and institutional settings. Findings also underscore the crucial roles of social influence in fostering positive user behaviors for Chat GPT. This study provides insights for educators and policymakers to develop strategies for integrating AI Chatbots responsibly and effectively in collegiate physics education while addressing ethical concerns. A longitudinal survey of the relationships between consistent AI Chatbot use, institutional support, student motivation, and learning outcomes is recommended. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Large language models such as ChatGPT are a challenge to academic principles, calling into question well-established practices, teaching and exam formats. This study aims to explore the adaptation process regarding text-generative artificial intelligence (AI) of students and teachers in higher education and to identify needs for change. Design/methodology/approach: The issue is explored in a mixed-methods approach based on Domestication Theory (Silverstone et al., 1992; Silverstone, 1994), incorporating views of both teaching staff and students. Both statistical and content analyses were carried out. Findings: The results show that both students and teachers are conflicted about generative AI and its usage. Trepidation and fear stand against a general feeling that AI is an integral part of the future and needs to be embraced. Both groups show marked needs for training and rules and offer a variety of ideas for new exam formats. Originality/value: This study provides a unique insight by exploring the attitudes and usage intentions regarding generative AI of two stakeholder groups: students and teachers. Its results can be of significant use to institutions deciding on their strategy regarding AI. It illustrates attitudes and usage intentions as well as needs of both groups. In addition, ideas for new assessment and teaching formats were generated. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy
AB  - This paper aims to study the opinions of teachers and students regarding the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in programming education. The research combines quantitative data from Likert-scale questions with qualitative data from open-ended responses. The findings reveal similarities between students’ and teachers’ views on the advantages of using ChatGPT in programming education and its potential to develop soft skills. A difference appears in assessing the attitudes of both groups toward the disadvantages of integrating ChatGPT in education. Compared to students, teachers express much greater concern about the negative effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on academic integrity and teaching quality. The results showed that both groups positively evaluate ChatGPT as a supplementary tool in education. They believe it should complement traditional teacher-student communication rather than replace it. Based on the research findings, the authors recommend that the integration of ChatGPT into education should be preceded by adopting university AI usage policies and training for the effective use of ChatGPT. Pedagogical guidelines for integrating ChatGPT into programming education are proposed to minimise the effect of students’ over-reliance on AI and achieve the learning outcomes defined by Bloom’s Taxonomy. © 2025 by the authors of this article.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (ai) technology is revolutionizing the way we live, learn, and work. In academic settings, tools such as chatbots, machine translation, and plagiarism detectors are becoming increasingly popular. However, as students’ use of these technologies becomes widespread, concerns about the impact it may have on learning, academic integrity, and the role of traditional teaching methods are growing. This paper aims to explore the perspectives of Argentinean teachers on the use of ai in higher education and on its advantages and drawbacks. Through an exploratory qualitative approach, we investigated how much knowledge teachers have about ai and whether they perceive its potential benefits and challenges and its impact on their teaching practices. Results show that L2 instructors exhibit low levels of familiarity and experience with these resources, specifically generative machine translation (gmt) and chat generative pre-trained transformer (gpt). Although some of the interviewees showed positive attitudes towards incorporating these tools into their classes, we also identify their fears and skepticism about these resources in higher education, their concerns about fairness and responsibility, and the lack of knowledge to engage with the software in teaching practices. The study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing efl instructors’ varied perspectives on ai, which is crucial for effectively integrating these technologies into L2 education. © (2025), (Universidad de Antioquia).

AB  - Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into nursing practice has the potential to transform healthcare delivery. However, understanding the factors influencing nursing students’ readiness to adopt AI is essential for effective implementation. This study aimed to explore the behavioral intentions of nursing students to use AI by examining the interplay of ethical awareness, digital literacy, moral sensitivity, attitudes, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social influence. A descriptive cross-sectional methodological design was used to recruit 460 nursing students from two governmental universities in Jordan. Data were collected using validated self-administered questionnaires and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the interrelationships among the variables. Findings revealed that positive attitudes (β = 0.43, p <.001), digital literacy (β = 0.40, p <.001), self-efficacy (β = 0.36, p <.001), and AI ethical awareness (β = 0.31, p <.001) were significant predictors of behavioral intention to use AI. Participation in AI workshops and social support also positively influenced intentions, while negative attitudes (β = -0.29, p <.001) and anxiety (β = -0.15, p <.001) served as barriers. Together, these factors accounted for 47% of the variance in behavioral intention (R2 = 0.47). In this scope, educational institutions should prioritize AI-focused training and ethics curricula, while healthcare policymakers should develop robust guidelines and invest in educational resources to prepare a workforce equipped for AI-integrated healthcare. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rise of AI in higher education offers significant opportunities for streamlining learning outcomes, operational efficiency, and even institutional progress. Besides personalized learning systems, the adoption of AI should integrate these ethical, and sometimes even legal, frameworks. The student's engagement and academic performance can be best improved with adaptive learning technologies and predictive analytics. Also, included in the study are; identification and exploration of limits, such as challenges faced by emerging technologies, meaning that students need to be cautious. Data breaches, biases in algorithms, scarce resources, and resistance to change will work as unique obstacles; hence, suggestions presented will be quite specific to each of these themes. Higher education will undergo transformative changes, traversing from inclusivity and innovation through the mechanisms of stronger governance, capacity building, and international cooperation; with AI, such pathways are possible. Such discoveries underscore the importance of developing interdisciplinary research capable of generating both transparent and effective frameworks. This would ensure that the longer-term impact of AI utilization is harmonized with educational and societal targets. © 2025, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some serious instances of plagiarism have been discussed in Bangladesh's institutions, where students, researchers, and even faculty members were given severe penalties. This study explores the factors influencing teachers of English at the tertiary level in Bangladesh regarding plagiarism, including emerging concerns around AI-based plagiarism. A mixed-method research design has been used to answer two research questions: (1) What are the perceptions of English teachers about plagiarism at the tertiary level? and (2) What are the factors that influence these perceptions? Data were collected through a survey questionnaire administered to 128 English teachers from 25 public and private universities in Bangladesh, followed by in-depth interviews with 10 teachers involved in research supervision. Factor analysis revealed institutional negligence, lack of writing courses, absence of plagiarism policies, and infrequent use of plagiarism detection software as major drivers of plagiarism. The thematic analysis identified concerns relating to the misuse of AI tools that escalate plagiarism and make its detection difficult. Respondents expressed the need for guidelines with respect to the ethical application of AI in academic writing. Recommendations include making writing courses mandatory, including plagiarism policies in course outline, and implementing AI-specific plagiarism detection tools to strengthen the academic integrity of higher education. © 2025 European Knowledge Development (EUROKD).

AB  - In recent years, the adoption of AI technologies in academia has increased, prompting a need to explain factors driving scholars to adopt or plan to adopt AI technologies in research routines. This study integrates three models into one integrated model: TAM, UTAUT, and SCT. These three models are combined to understand how GenAI self-efficacy, perceived ethics, academic integrity, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risks, ease of use, and perceived usefulness influenced the participants’ intention to adopt GenAI in research. Following this, data were collected from Egyptian academics linked to Egyptian universities. There were 742 responses to this question. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The paper's results showed that GenAI self-efficacy, social influence, and perceived ethics are significantly related to perceptions of ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use GenAI. Facilitating conditions have a negative effect on perceived ease of use, and perceived risk does not affect perceived usefulness or intention to use significantly. Notably, the result found that ethics and academic integrity affect perceptions of GenAI's usage and utility. This guide illustrates how universities must take proactive steps to influence how AI will be used and reinforces the importance of using these tools within an ethical lens. This paper emphasizes the need to balance the use of generative AI and ethical practices. It examines the role of ethics and academic integrity in perceptions that influence attitudes toward the use of generative AI. They represent a step forward in our understanding of how to induce AI adoption–in this case, in the academic context, and specifically in Egypt. Additionally, it places sound emphasis on the role of AI technology and how it can be beneficial whilst advocating for a sensible approach in that application, which includes ethical principles. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - World Journal of English Language
AB  - The widespread use of internet-based media and AI-powered tools for learning has provided students with convenient access to information and writing assistance. However, rather than improving their English academic writing skills, such reliance may lead to academic misconduct, including plagiarism and unethical use of AI-generated content. Such concerns motivate the researchers to gain insights from 50 second-semester students in Indonesia enrolled in two English essay writing courses regarding academic integrity and violations. Employing a qualitative descriptive approach, data were collected through a questionnaire assessing students’ understanding of academic integrity, followed by an analysis of 94 essays from 47 students before and after completing the questionnaire. Findings revealed a notable gap between students’ conceptual understanding of academic integrity and their actual writing practices. Although students recognized the importance of ethical writing, instances of plagiarism from internet sources and AI-generated text incorporation persisted. These discrepancies stem from underdeveloped English writing proficiency, lack of awareness about plagiarism, and dependency on digital assistance. The study underscores the need for early and continuous instruction in academic integrity and English writing skills, along with institutional policies and support systems to mitigate academic misconduct in English academic writing. © 2025 Sciedu Press.

AB  - This study examines the multifaceted dimensions of artificial intelligence literacy among library and information science students across South Asia, focusing on socio-demographic variables such as country, level of study, gender identity and English-language competency. A survey of 914 participants from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan highlights notable disparities in artificial intelligence literacy levels, with Indian students excelling in conceptual understanding and ethical awareness, Bangladeshi students demonstrating practical artificial intelligence proficiency and Pakistani students showing heightened sensitivity to ethical concerns. The findings reveal that advanced levels of study correlate with greater artificial intelligence literacy, while language competency influences familiarity and understanding but not overall proficiency. While artificial intelligence tools are widely used for academic tasks like information searching, proofreading and article summarization, limited exposure to advanced applications and pervasive ethical concerns – such as academic integrity and plagiarism – underscore the need for targeted interventions in library and information science education. This research contributes to the global discourse on artificial intelligence literacy by providing empirical evidence to inform curriculum development, policymaking and professional readiness. It advocates for inclusive, ethical and regionally tailored artificial intelligence literacy programmes to prepare library and information science students for the demands of artificial-intelligence-driven library and information management services, enriching both local and international library and information science education frameworks. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Australasian Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - There is a growing need to upskill higher education (HE) teachers for the effective and responsible integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their classrooms. This case study sought to address this growing need by designing and delivering a training course for educators, focusing on the use of ChatGPT as it was the most commonly used tool at the time. The professional development opportunity lasted 5 weeks and covered critical aspects of GenAI use for teaching and learning. Data collected from participants included discussion board entries, written tasks and focus groups. Findings highlight some of the common practices and concerns HE practitioners had regarding the use of GenAI in their practice. The findings also emphasise the importance of providing teachers with customised GenAI training to facilitate its effective integration in HE contexts. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose the TPTP Support System for Teachers, built upon four key areas: teacher training, pedagogical support, testing revamp and practice networks. This system aims to guide institutional efforts to facilitate and support educators as they integrate GenAI in HE. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

AB  - Academic integrity is a cornerstone of education systems, yet the rise of contract cheating poses significant challenges for higher education institutions. Current approaches to managing contract cheating often lack the comprehensive structure needed to address the complexities of modern cheating methods. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed Three-Tier Framework (TTF), designed in our previous study to combat contract cheating. The proposed framework comprises three tiers: awareness, monitoring, and evaluation. It engages stakeholders within the system and encourages a proactive and collaborative stance against contract cheating while reinforcing a culture of academic honesty. The evaluation focuses on three key aspects: the clarity of the framework’s functions and objectives, the potential challenges in implementing the proposed monitoring process, and the perceived limitations in detecting and mitigating contract cheating through this framework. Supervised and unsupervised assignments are considered, excluding the option of e-proctoring, as some students encountered difficulties setting up necessary tools and software for online exams. Survey results reveal a broad consensus among respondents, who expressed strong confidence in the clarity and effectiveness of the framework and its monitoring procedures. These positive perceptions were consistent across respondents, regardless of their prior experience or familiarity with contract cheating. Although the overall feedback was positive, concerns were raised regarding implementing the framework in current educational settings. Specific challenges cited include tight timelines and the increased workload associated with the new procedures, emphasising a need for additional guidance, training, and institutional support to ensure effective adoption. The proposed framework incorporates an instructor dashboard designed to streamline academic workflow and simplify the monitoring process introduced in this framework. The survey results confirm that the framework can be adopted to address the unique needs of academics and diverse educational environments; however further research is needed to explore its applicability across the broader higher education community. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Providing timely and personalized feedback on open-ended student responses is a challenge in education due to the increased workloads and time constraints educators face. While existing research has explored how learning analytic approaches can support feedback provision, previous studies have not sufficiently investigated educators' perspectives of how these strategies affect the assessment process. This paper reports on the findings of a study that aimed to evaluate the impact of an AI-driven platform designed to assist educators in the assessment and feedback process. Leveraging Large Language Models and learning analytics, the platform supports educators by offering tag-based recommendations and AI-generated feedback to enhance the quality and efficiency of open-response evaluations. A controlled experiment involving 65 higher education instructors assessed the platform's effectiveness in real-world environments. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, this study investigated the platform's usefulness and relevance from the instructors' perspectives. Moreover, we collected data from the platform's usage to identify partners in instructors' behavior for different scenarios. Results indicate that AI-driven feedback significantly improved instructors' ability to provide detailed, personalized feedback in less time. This study contributes to the growing research on AI applications in educational assessment and highlights key considerations for adopting AI-driven tools in instructional settings. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This study examines the risks affecting digital transformation in higher education institutions in Kazakhstan through a multi-method research approach. The investigation integrates quantitative surveys (N=4,971 students), qualitative focus groups (N=100 faculty and administrators), and expert evaluations using PEST analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of transformation challenges. Key findings revealed that scientific and technical factors emerged as the most significant risk drivers (x? = 8.25), followed by economic constraints (x? = 7.62) and organizational readiness barriers (x?= 6.71). Survey results indicated that while 64.4% of students perceived digital technologies as beneficial for learning, 47.8% reported difficulties with digital platform usage. Focus group interviews highlighted critical challenges in three domains: infrastructure limitations (cited by 68% of faculty), pedagogical adaptation needs (noted by 72%), and ethical implications of AI integration (expressed by 85%). The PEST analysis identified technological factors as primary risk drivers, with rapid platform adoption and data security concerns ranked highest. The study advances a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating both internal and external risks in digital transformation, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions, organizational development strategies, and enhanced institutional readiness measures. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and institutional leaders implementing digital transformation initiatives in emerging educational contexts. © 2025 Fırtına Akademi A.Ş.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as ChatGPT, Bard, Gemini, and Copilot, have revolutionized education, capturing the attention of faculty, administration, and students alike. Academic libraries have actively engaged in facilitating the use of AI technologies while addressing challenges like misinformation, academic integrity concerns, and ethical considerations. This study examines AI integration, education, and outreach in academic libraries across Europe, North America (Canada and USA), Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. An environmental scan of 40 academic library websites from the Times Higher Education 10 highest-ranked libraries in each region was conducted. Results show that more than 50% of the libraries offered educational materials and 42.5% conducted educational activities, while only 12.5% included AI policies. The study results demonstrate that although many libraries have begun to integrate AI into their services, significant differences exist between regions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The use of AI technology in education has generated an increasing interest in teachers, academicians, researchers, and students. This study synthesizes the responses from a survey conducted among 2230 students at a technical university in Czechia, aiming to capture their attitudes towards integrating AI technology in academic settings. We analyzed students’ perceptions on familiarity with the topic, perceived benefits and challenges of AI in education, ethical aspects, and perspectives for their teachers on this technology. A questionnaire was designed and administered within the frame of this study. Results reveal that the majority of respondents are familiar with and use AI technology, most of whom use it ‘sometimes’ or ‘commonly.’ Information processing and understanding is the most common purpose for using AI. Time efficiency and accessibility are the most reported advantages of AI, while the potential disadvantages involve credibility, overreliance, misuse, and scope-level concerns. Half of participants suggest students rarely or never consider ethical issues in their AI use. Most students believe that universities should clarify the gray areas regarding how and in which areas AI is allowed by establishing relevant ethical guidelines. Nearly half of student participants report that their teachers are moderately or more open to improving their understanding of AI use, while only a minority report that their teachers use it in practice. © 2024 by the authors of this.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - In this study, the researchers explore lecturers’ perspectives on the impact artificial intelligence (AI) has on blended learning within the context of South African higher education. AI is transforming traditional teaching and learning by enabling academic institutions to offer computerised, effective, and objective educational processes. The research was conducted to address the growing need to understand lecturers’ viewpoints on how AI can enhance educational practices and overcome existing challenges in blended learning environments. To investigate this phenomenon, the researchers applied the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) model as theoretical framework for the study. Their qualitative research undertaking employed a singular case study design focusing on 15 lecturers from the College of Education at a selected academic institution, to arrive at an in-depth understanding of lecturers’ experiences and perceptions of how AI is integrated in blended learning. The researchers examined both the benefits and challenges associated with a blended teaching and learning mode, in the context of AI integration. The data collection process involved semi-structured focus group interviews that allowed for in-depth discussions to be conducted. This was complemented by detailed document analysis to analyse the course materials and teaching methods used by the lecturers. Homogeneous, purposeful sampling was applied to select participating lecturers who shared specific characteristics relevant to the study. Data analysis involved coding through the induction method, which helped to reveal relevant codes that were subsequently categorised. The study also included a comprehensive literature review of recent research findings, which were correlated with the collected data. The findings underscored the critical need for supportive measures, such as management backing, enhanced training opportunities, professional development initiatives, reliable technological infrastructure, improved internet connectivity, and additional time allocation, for the successful implementation of blended learning which integrates AI. This study contributes valuable insights into, and discussions on, the implications of adopting AI in a hybrid learning environment. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Most higher education institutions employ study advisors to support their students. To adequately perform their task, study advisors have access to study information about their students. Using AI techniques to analyze that information and to predict if a student might be at risk of study delay could be a valuable tool in study advisors' practice. In this paper, we present a use case of how such a tool was developed (in the form of a dashboard) and which steps and considerations played a role in the responsible deployment of the tool. Three aspects are described: first, we present the timeline of the case study and zoom in on how the macro-level of the institution (where the groundwork is laid to facilitate AI-systems in education) and the micro-level of the implementation of the system influenced each other. Second, we describe which stakeholders were involved and what their ethical considerations were concerning data management, algorithms, and pedagogy. Third, we describe the initial evaluation of the dashboard in terms of study advisors’ experiences and provide suggestions on how to stimulate the responsible and useful implementation of a predictive modelling tool. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - This systematic literature review (SLR) study explores artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool to address academics challenges in South African higher education. Numerous difficulties beset higher education system in South Africa, such as a lack of funding, high student-to-lecturer ratios, and unequal access to high-quality education. Relevant academic databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, ERIC, and Web of Science, was searched using a combination of keywords relating to South African higher education, AI in education, academic issues, and AI technologies. A total of twenty (20) documents were identified and used in this study. The examination looks at how AI is currently being used, how it affects how people teach and learn, and the opportunities and challenges that come with using it in this setting. The results show that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including automated assessment tools, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive learning platforms, have the potential to improve personalized learning experiences, boost student engagement and academic performance, and facilitate effective management of educational resources. However, overcoming several issues, such as a lack of technological know-how, restricted infrastructure, concerns about equity, and ethical implications is necessary for the successful integration of AI in South African higher education. It encourages educators, politicians, and technology experts to work together to establish long-term solutions for incorporating AI into teaching and learning processes while maintaining inclusivity, equity and ethical issues. ©Authors.

AB  - The growing use of generative AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) calls the sustainability of traditional assessment practices into question. Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate eloquent essays on any topic and in any language, write code in various programming languages, and ace most standardized tests, all within seconds. We conducted an international survey of educators and students in higher education to understand and compare their perspectives on the impact of generative AI across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Across three universities, 680 students and 87 educators, who moderately use generative AI, consider essay and coding assessments to be most impacted. Educators strongly prefer assessments that are adapted to assume the use of AI and encourage critical thinking, while students' reactions are mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, alongside higher-order thinking and authentic applications. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Telematics and Informatics
AB  - In response to China's ‘smart campus’ trend, facial recognition technology (FRT) in higher education has evolved from identification to emotion recognition, raising various risks and controversies. Understanding college students’ perceptions is key to addressing these concerns and facilitating AI integration. This study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to gauge students’ attitudes towards FRT, introducing three new constructs: ‘personal innovativeness,’ ‘trust in the system,’ and ‘perceived risks.’ Results show that students’ personal innovativeness and trust in the system positively relate to their acceptance intention. Trust in FRT is hindered by perceived privacy, psychological, and performance risks, while perceived social risks are insignificant. Higher education shows less resistance to FRT due to normalized campus surveillance. Compared to Western societies, Chinese students’ Confucian cultural stance of ‘harmony but not uniformity’ reduces concerns about racial or religious discrimination from FRT. These findings are crucial for assessing FRT's necessity and legality in higher education and devising risk mitigation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - This research investigates bias in AI algorithms used for monitoring student progress, specifically focusing on bias related to age, disability, and gender. The study is motivated by incidents such as the UK A-level grading controversy, which demonstrated the real-world implications of biased algorithms. Using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, the research evaluates fairness with metrics like ABROCA, Average Odds Difference, and Equality of Opportunity Difference. The analysis is structured into three experiments. The first experiment examines fairness as an attribute of the data sources and reveals that institutional data is the primary contributor to model discrimination, followed by Virtual Learning Environment data, while assessment data is the least biased. In the second experiment, the research introduces the Optimal Time Index, which pinpoints Day 60 of an average 255-day course as the optimal time for predicting student outcomes, balancing timely interventions, model accuracy, and efficient resource allocation. The third experiment implements bias mitigation strategies throughout the model's life cycle, achieving fairness without compromising accuracy. Finally, this study introduces the Student Progress Card, designed to provide actionable personalized feedback for each student. © 2024 The Authors

It emphasises the view of AI's involvement in administrative activities in higher education, experts' opinions concerning the influence of the incorporation of AI on learning and teaching, and experts' views on applying AI specifically to assessment, academic integrity, and ethical considerations. The study used a qualitative method based on an unstructured qualitative interview with open-ended questions. The participants were thirteen individuals currently involved with higher education institutions and had various talents related to AI and education. Findings stress that implementing AI technology in administrative roles within higher education institutions is essential since it cuts costs, addresses problems efficiently and effectively, and saves time. The findings also revealed that AI plays a vital role in learning and teaching by speeding up the learning process, engaging learners and tutors, and personalising learning depending on the learner's needs within an entirely intelligent environment. AI can produce an accurate, objective, and suitable level of assessment. AI aids students in developing a stronger sense of integrity in their academic work by guiding them through AI-powered applications. AI must adhere to ethical laws and policies, ensuring its potential negative aspects are not overlooked or left unchecked. © 2024 The Author(s).

T2  - Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching and Learning
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on students' learning experiences and perceptions through a master’s-level course. The study specifically focused on student engagement, comfort with GenAI and ethical considerations. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an action research methodology employing qualitative data collection methods, including pre- and post-course surveys, reflective assignments, class discussions and a questionnaire. The AI-Ideas, Connections, Extensions (ICE) Framework, combining the ICE Model and AI paradigms, is used to assess students' cognitive engagement with GenAI. Findings: The study revealed that incorporating GenAI in a master’s-level instructional design course increased students' comfort with GenAI and their understanding of its ethical implications. The AI-ICE Framework demonstrated most students were at the initial engagement level, with growing awareness of GenAI’s limitations and ethical issues. Course reflections highlighted themes of improved teaching strategies, personal growth and the practical challenges of integrating GenAI responsibly. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size poses challenges to the analytical power of the findings, potentially limiting the breadth and applicability of conclusions. This constraint may affect the generalizability of the results, as the participants may not fully represent the broader population of interest. The researchers are mindful of these limitations and suggest caution in interpreting the findings, acknowledging that they may offer more exploratory insights than definitive conclusions. Future research endeavors should aim to recruit a larger cohort to validate and expand upon the initial observations, ensuring a more robust understanding. Originality/value: The study is original in its integration of GenAI into a master's-level instructional design course, assessing both the practical and ethical implications of its use in education. By utilizing the AI-ICE Framework to evaluate students' cognitive engagement and employing action research methodology, the study provides insights into how GenAI influences learning experiences and perceptions. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and the real-world application of GenAI, offering actionable strategies for its responsible use in educational settings. © 2024, Dwayne Wood and Scott H.

TI  - Are AI detection and plagiarism similarity scores worthwhile in the age of ChatGPT and other Generative AI?
AU  - Baron, P.
T2  - SOTL in the South
AB  - Recent advancements in chatbots have provided students and academics with a new mode of how knowledge can be sourced and composed. Within a very short space of time, students and academics have flocked to use ChatGPT and other Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) platforms owing to their capable responses. Additionally, apart from the generative chatbots (such as ChatGPT and Gemini), AI writing tools for paraphrasing, summarising, and co-writing have also become capable and increasingly prevalent to such a degree that the public is spoilt for choice. Having conducted tests on popular chatbots and AI writing tools, it became clear that while programs like Turnitin are developing new algorithms to detect plagiarism and AI-generated content, the initial findings from this study suggest that this may be an increasingly difficult task. These tests were published on YouTube, and within a few weeks, the evidence garnered tens of thousands of views as students and educators seemed uncertain about the strengths, weaknesses, and legalities of these AI tools. What is clear is that we have passed the tipping point, and AI assistance is no longer just a grammar fixer. The implications of this are concerning and far-reaching, as plagiarism is already a significant problem in universities. This position paper reports on tests conducted using Turnitin software and AI writing tools such as ChatGPT and QuillBot. These real-world tests support the paper’s position that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes original work in a world of GAI. The aim of this article is to provide evidence that educators who rely on similarity checking and AI detectors in their current form may inadvertently be supporting plagiarism rather than reducing it. A new method of academic plagiarism detection is proposed, utilizing large language models to generate and track ideas, thereby serving as an idea database. The proposed method focuses on the "understanding" of the work rather than on text similarity. © 2024 University of Johannesburg. All rights reserved.

T2  - IAFOR Journal of Education
AB  - In the context of education, the issues of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching and maintaining academic integrity in students’ use of AI are particularly relevant. This paper empirically examined the issue of ChatGPT usage for writing homework from the perspectives of students and professors. Study research methods included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In Study 1, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 350 Croatian students, users of ChatGPT, to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, habits, and intentions regarding ChatGPT usage for homework assignments. In Study 2, twelve faculty members were tested on their accuracy of distinguishing between original students’ papers and ChatGPT-generated papers. For this purpose, 25 different versions of papers for 8 different courses were prepared. The results of the students’ survey showed that most students still do not use ChatGPT regularly and have neutral attitudes about its usefulness, ease of use, risks, and intentions for future use. In addition, they were moderately concerned about ethical issues around its usage. Differences across gender and field of study were found. Professors, on the other hand, reported having average self-efficacy in appraising authorship, which is in line with their low average accuracy of 53%. Accuracy in distinguishing was lowest when ChatGPT was instructed to write a paper as a student. These results strongly suggest the necessity for clear guidelines, plagiarism detection tools, and educational initiatives to promote ethical use of AI technology. © 2024, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - Recent years have seen the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered generative chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Microsoft's Copilot. These tools have simultaneously positively surprised and taken aback people worldwide, raising the question of whether they can or should be used in education, as well as how to properly guide students and teachers on using them safely and ethically. To this end, this work provides (i) a brief overview of the current applications of AI in Higher Education (HE), (ii) a discussion of the ethical and societal concerns associated with the usage of AI models, (iii) the initial steps of the implementation of a chatbot used at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) able to perform audits for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and (iv) an investigation of the need and opportunities of AI in chemical engineering education. The latter is achieved through quantitative and qualitative analyses of the responses given by both Master's students and academia/industry practitioners on the introduction and use of AI in education. This paves the way for discussing current perceptions, expectations and concerns of AI models, as well as their limitations and the opportunities they could provide. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In a context where artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education, this study analyzes how students’ perceptions of AI influence their academic integrity (INA), with a focus on sustainable education. Through a correlational-explanatory analysis based on Structural Equation Models (SEMs) applied to a sample of 659 students from 13 universities in Chile and Peru, it is observed that AI has a significant and direct impact on academic integrity in both countries (β = 0.44). In Peru, the most influential dimension is trust in education (λ = 0.86), followed by social, economic, security, and risk implications (λ = 0.78), while attitudes towards AI also have a direct impact on integrity factors (β = 0.15). In Chile, the dimensions of trust in education (λ = 0.83) and social and economic impact (λ = 0.79) are most relevant, and the relationships between the dimensions of academic integrity such as justice, respect, and responsibility (λ = 0.71) are stronger. The study highlights the importance of incorporating AI literacy into educational curricula and developing regulatory frameworks that promote its ethical use, linking these actions to sustainable education. The findings highlight the need for sustainable educational approaches that enhance understanding of AI and ensure that its use in academia is beneficial, ethical, and contributes to sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly significant in education, the lack of teacher readiness continues to hinder its effective use in language teaching in Kazakhstan. This study aims to address this gap by exploring EFL teachers’ experiences with AI integration and assessing their ethical competences. Using a mixed-methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data from survey and semi-structured interviews (further coded, and thematically analyzed) were collected from 60 English language teachers from different universities in Kazakhstan. The results indicated that language teachers were least confident in ethical use of AI in language teachings. The findings revealed the finalized six main ethical competences and 24 sub-competences, including (i) AI literacy competence, (ii) pedagogical and technical competence, (iii) assessment and reflection competence, (iv) facilitation of student autonomy competence, (v) professional and legal ethics competence, and (vi) responsibility and accountability competence. These competences offer a framework for developing future EFL teaching and learning programs that maximize AI’s benefits while addressing potential ethical challenges. © 2024, Qubahan.

AB  - As generative AI (GenAI) policies in higher education in Thailand have been introduced, inquiries regarding GenAI integration and adoption in teaching and learning have been raised. Delving into a relatively unexplored interdisciplinary area in this context, this study aimed to investigate students' responses towards the use of GenAI in academic and professional public relations (PR) writing, employing the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) frameworks. This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured focus group sessions among native Thai PR major university students, with a workshop on GenAI prior to the discussion on its adoption. The findings revealed that all participants were aware of GenAI and most had utilized it for daily and academic purposes, but never in professional PR writing. Despite having positive attitudes towards its use after the trial, they recognized certain drawbacks and concerns and expressed some reservations towards adopting GenAI in their future academic and professional PR writing, rather in English than in Thai. Besides knowledge and perceptions, individual characteristics were also attributed to hindering GenAI adoption among some participants. Therefore, providing adequate resources and practical guidelines on appropriate GenAI use are crucial. Future research in other subject areas and languages is suggested. © 2024 Language Institute, Thammasat University. All rights reserved.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has brought profound changes to higher education. While many studies have examined the potential use of ChatGPT in teaching and learning, few have explored the opportunities to develop assessments that facilitate the use of multiple technological innovations (i.e. traditional AI and GenAI tools). We conducted qualitative research to address this gap. The assessments of an elective English course in Hong Kong were re-designed to incorporate GenAI and other tools. Students were asked to employ and reflect on their use of these tools for their writing assessments. We analyzed the written reflections of 74 students and conducted focus group interviews with 28 students. The results suggest that the students possess an acumen for choosing the appropriate online tools for specific purposes. When they can choose freely, they develop skills that allow them to evaluate and select between traditional AI and GenAI tools when appropriate. Some students mentioned concerns with the different features of the free and premium versions. The results of this study call for (1) assessment practices that allow the flexibility to use different AI tools and (2) the equitable use of various AI tools. © 2024

AB  - The potential application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in schools and universities poses great challenges, especially for the assessment of students’ texts. Previous research has shown that people generally have difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that novice (N = 89) and experienced teachers (N = 200) could not identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written texts. However, there are some indications that more experienced teachers made more differentiated and more accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed source on quality assessment were heterogeneous. Our findings demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which poses a challenge to schools and universities in grading student essays. Our study provides empirical evidence for the current debate regarding exam strategies in schools and universities in light of the latest technological developments. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In recent months, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had, and will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This article addresses three key questions related to the ethical facets of algorithmic literacy. First, it synthesizes existing literature to identify six core ethical components, including bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, accuracy, and non-maleficence. Second, a crosswalk maps the intersections of these principles across the Association of College and Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and Joint Statement on Principles for Responsible Algorithmic Systems. This analysis reveals significant overlap on issues like unfairness and transparency, helping prioritize topics for instruction. Finally, case studies showcase pedagogical strategies for teaching ethical considerations, informed by the crosswalk. Workshops for diverse undergraduates and computer science students employed reallife instances of algorithmic bias to prompt reflection on unintended harm, contestability, and responsible development. Pre-post surveys indicated expanded critical perspectives after the interventions. By systematically examining shared values and testing instructional approaches, this study provides practical tools to shape ethical thinking on algorithms. It also demonstrates promising practices for responsibly advancing algorithmic literacy across disciplines. Ultimately, fostering interdisciplinary awareness and multipronged educational initiatives can empower students to question algorithmic authority and biases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Exploring the implementation of artificial intelligence applications among academic libraries in Taiwan
AU  - Huang, Y.-H.
T2  - Library Hi Tech
AB  - Purpose: This study explored the different artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in academic libraries and the key factors and impediments related to their implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The author applied quantitative research methods in the form of a questionnaire, using both open and closed questions. A total of 472 valid questionnaires were received from academic librarians. Findings: The author sought responses from librarians who had implemented AI applications and those who had not, identifying the types of AI applications implemented, key factors relating to their implementation, and impediments to promoting AI. Gaps were identified between the level of support for AI applications and the negative effect of the impediments. Furthermore, the more extensive the individual and organizational knowledge activities performed by the librarians and libraries held, the more positive the attitude was librarians' attitude toward AI applications in their libraries. However, librarians recognized that AI applications are inevitable, but indicated that the difficulties of in execution have hampered the adoption of AI. Research limitations/implications: The sample data were collected in Taiwan; therefore, the data may only represent the views of Taiwanese academic librarians on AI applications. The results of this study may not apply to librarians worldwide; however, they may provide a useful reference. Practical implications: The results revealed the top four AI applications that libraries would most likely implement in the near future. Therefore, AI application developers and suppliers can prioritize the promotion of these products for to academic libraries. This study revealed that funding and costs related to AI implementation were discovered to be key factors relating to implementing AI applications. Some impediments to the implementation of AI applications relate to technological problems. Several librarians suggested that managers should invest more resources at an early stage rather than reducing cutting back on human resources initially. Although worries regarding privacy and ethics were mentioned expressed by some respondents, most academic librarians did not regard these to be major concerns. Originality/value: This study provides the perspectives of librarians who have implemented AI applications and of those who have not. In addition, it explores the advantages and disadvantages of AI applications, and the level of support for and impact of AI applications and promotions. This study also included a gap analysis. Moreover, individual and organizational knowledge activity scales were adopted to examine AI awareness and the perceptions of academic librarians. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - Feedback, particularly the formative or ‘feed-forward’ type is important for students in higher education to understand their errors and improve their expression and clarity of ideas. While technology-assisted feedback modes, e.g., audio or video are prevalent, ensuring their efficacy and succinctness, particularly for non-English-speaking background (NESB) educators can be challenging. This study investigates the attitudes and experiences of NESB educators in the School of Engineering of RMIT University, with a focus on their use of AI-assisted tools for providing feedback to students in higher education settings. Utilising a survey, the researchers examined how personal and linguistic attributes influenced feedback strategies and explored the educators' perspectives on integrating AI tools, such as ChatGPT and BARD, in their teaching practice and to enhance student engagement with the feedback they received. Through thematic analysis the findings reveal that personal background and linguistic proficiency significantly influenced the provision of feedback. Furthermore, even though educators had different levels of familiarity with AI-assisted tools, there was a general consensus on the potential utility of these tools for improving feedback provision. These will require targeted staff training, careful human oversight to ensure quality and avoid bias, and customised AI training to align feedback with individual teaching styles. © by the authors,.

AB  - The higher education (HE) sector benefits every nation’s economy and society at large. However, their contributions are challenged by advanced technologies like generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive assessment of GenAI tools towards assessment and pedagogic practice and, subsequently, discuss the potential impacts. This study experimented using three assessment instruments from data science, data analytics, and construction management disciplines. Our findings are two-fold: first, the findings revealed that GenAI tools exhibit subject knowledge, problem-solving, analytical, critical thinking, and presentation skills and thus can limit learning when used unethically. Secondly, the design of the assessment of certain disciplines revealed the limitations of the GenAI tools. Based on our findings, we made recommendations on how AI tools can be utilised for teaching and learning in HE. © 2024.

AB  - The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has led to the creation of ChatGPT. Despite its potential benefits, the effects of ChatGPT on higher education accessibility and inclusion are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of ChatGPT on the accessibility and inclusivity in higher education for students. We delivered five questions to identify the applicability of ChatGPT, including the utilization of ChatGPT in higher education, the benefits of ChatGPT in higher education, the perception of quality answered by ChatGPT, user-friendliness interface of ChatGPT, and ChatGPT on enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. These focus questions were purposefully created to strategise the integration of ChatGPT within the higher education framework. Total of 85 respondents, comprising undergradu-ate students from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Nigeria participated in this study. It was found that a significant 75.6% of respondents feel ChatGPT has enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. This highlights the potential of AI technologies to improve educational environment by increasing accessibility and levelling the learning ecosystem for students with various requirements and back-grounds. There was still a widespread distinction of knowledge and viewpoints among students. Although some students consider ChatGPT to be just marginally useful and are only slightly satisfied with its quality, others express high satisfaction. It is important to note that some students did not find ChatGPT to be useful and have reservations about its accuracy. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of ChatGPT can play in decreasing barriers to education and fostering more classroom diversity. The findings of this study can also inform the development of best practises for incorporating technology such as ChatGPT into higher education institutions. This would eventually optimise ChatGPT potential impact on accessibility and inclusivity. All in all, this study can play a crucial role in changing the future of higher education using ChatGPT and ensuring that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed. © The Author(s).

T2  - Educational Technology and Society
AB  - Technostress is a phenomenon in which rapid technological advancement affects teachers’ psychological well-being. It is an emerging concern in English language education, which may be exacerbated by the advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT. This study explores the factors that influence technostress among English language teachers using GenAI tools and strategies that can alleviate it. Based on the analysis of qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 16 instructors at higher education institutions in Hong Kong, the study identifies the rapid advancement of AI technology, inadequate training and lack of experience as contributors to technostress. It also names mitigating strategies including targeted professional development, online engagement and gradual integration. These techniques can foster Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and reduce the challenges of incorporating GenAI into English teaching. The findings align with existing literature on the impact of technostress and the role of TPACK. The practical implications include the need for comprehensive training, supportive communities and a balanced approach to AI integration. This investigation also expands the theoretical understanding of technostress in English language teaching and the use of GenAI tools, providing empirical support for existing frameworks. It also suggests directions for future research, which could investigate teacher well-being, effective AI integration and the impact of TPACK. © (2024), (Educational Technology and Society).

TI  - Ethical concerns for using artificial intelligence chatbots in research and publication: Evidences from Saudi Arabia
AU  - Sobaih, A.E.E.
T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational generative chatbots have drawn the attention of academics and have been increasingly used in the scientific research process since the inauguration of ChatGPT in November 2022. Despite growing research on AI chatbots’ usage in research and publication, limited studies have deeply addressed the ethical concerns that arise from their usage. This research explores the perceptions of academics and their leaders regarding the use of AI chatbots in research and publication. It addresses the ethical dilemma and ethical approaches considered by academics and their leaders for shaping their decisions for the use or non-use of chatbots in scientific research. For these purposes, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 academics/researchers and 11 leaders of scientific research in public universities in Saudi Arabia. The results of the thematic analysis confirmed that AI chatbots are extensively used in scientific research, albeit many researchers present their publications as their own work with no acknowledgement of the support from chatbots. The results showed ten interrelated ethical concerns, which would impact the growth of pseudoscience in developing countries if these concerns were not overcome. Hence, strategies for mitigating these ethical concerns are suggested. The research showed that academics often use chatbots based on a “utilitarian” approach, whereas most leaders consider the “virtue” or the “common good” approach for their concerns about chatbot adoption in scientific research. This research calls for policy and interventions from policymakers and other stakeholders about the responsible and ethical use of chatbots in research and publication. © 2024. Abu Elnasr E. Sobaih.

T2  - Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship
AB  - This study employed a descriptive survey to investigate librarians’ perspectives on data privacy and ethical use of public AI chatbots by patrons. The survey of 34 librarians at private university libraries in Nigeria revealed general awareness of applicable laws and privacy risks, but gaps in specific regulatory knowledge like the GDPR. Ethical concerns emerged as paramount, with strong agreement on needs for guidelines around privacy, transparency, consent, and mitigating bias. While initial steps have been taken, major challenges include lack of uniform standards, resource constraints, rapid technology changes, staff training gaps, and difficulties verifying AI vendors’ data practices. Key recommendations emphasize developing clear policies prioritizing user consent and data transparency, verifying vendor practices, regular staff training, assessing risks, gathering patron feedback, and cross-institutional collaboration on best practices. Adequate resources and measures safeguarding patron privacy while benefiting from AI capabilities are vital for promoting ethical public AI chatbot use in libraries. © 2024 The Author(s).

The participants assessed sample GenAI reviews, and their perspec tives were recorded through numerical, best-adjective, and open-ended surveys. The findings revealed pervasively positive views across the AI feedback. Numerical survey results showed that the feedback was generally deemed relevant, clear, actionable, useful, and comprehensive. The best-adjective survey further specified the nature of these views. Openended responses supported both findings, suggesting that GenAI feedback aligned well with course rubrics and provided actionable suggestions. Nevertheless, some limitations were identified, such as redundancy and how lengthy suggestions could overwhelm students. The study offers suggestions for the improvement of fine-tuned GenAI feedback to improve its effectiveness and enhance higher education students’ learning experiences, especially in online settings. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Recent disruptions to higher education, including generative artificial intelligence, have highlighted an increased need for student support, particularly to enable a smooth transition in first-year university. The timing and the tone of support are critical. Here, content expert tutors were embedded in 24 first-year units to provide one-on-one draft assessment feedforward. Tutors received training on using the principle of the pedagogy of kindness; showing concern, compassion and empathy when interacting with students, and raising academic misconduct concerns. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of employing a pedagogy of kindness in tutor sessions on preventing academic integrity issues. Of the 704 draft assessments submitted, 51 students (7%) engaged in a discussion regarding academic integrity. Of these 51 students, 45 students passed their unit and only one required further investigation for academic misconduct. Tutors proactively contacted students who were identified as at risk of failing their unit. At-risk students who met with a tutor were more likely to pass their subject and achieved a higher average cumulative mark (51% vs 41%, p<0.05). In this paper, we evaluate how tutors providing a pedagogy of kindness increased meaningful learning and student success when incorporating cognitive presence. A responsive strategy using this pedagogical approach was implemented to address the increased use of generative artificial intelligence tools and to decrease the incidence of student academic misconduct. © 2024, Kaplan Singapore.

T2  - Information Development
AB  - The increasing dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing tools among advanced learners has sparked concerns about academic dishonesty, prompting stakeholders to develop ways to maintain academic integrity. The study explored the role of academic librarians in maintaining academic integrity with the prevalence of AI writing tools among students. The study was conducted through qualitative methods with a phenomenological design. A semi-structured interview was used to collect data from twelve academic librarians in six universities in Ghana. The data was analysed thematically with word clouds. The findings of the study revealed that the roles of academic librarians are more tailored towards maintaining research integrity, an aspect of academic integrity. Also, the study observed that academic librarians play relevant roles in empowering students on the ethical use of information in the current dispensation of AI application tools in learning. Based on the study's findings, it is recommended a skill upgrade of library staff in evolving AI technology in response to issues of academic misconduct among students. Furthermore, the study suggests that academic institutions should revise academic integrity policies to address the increasing use of AI writing tools among students. © The Author(s) 2024.

TI  - A widely used Generative-AI detector yields zero false positives

AB  - The widespread availability of generative-AI using Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided the means for students and others to easily cheat on written assignments - that is, students can use AI to generate text and then submit that work as their own. A variety of technical solutions have been developed to detect such cheating. However, concerns have been raised about the dangers of falsely identifying real students' responses as having been generated by AI. Here we evaluate a Generative AI detector that comes as an option with Turnitin, a widely used plagiarism-detection platform already in use at many universities. We compare 160 responses written by students in a class assignment with 160 responses generated by ChatGPT instructed to complete the same assignment. The ChatGPT responses were generated by 16 different prompts crafted to mimic those that plausibly might be given by individuals seeking to cheat on an assignment. The AI scores for the AI generated responses were significantly higher than the AI scores for the human-generated responses, which were all zero. Clearly, an arms race is set to develop between technology that facilitates cheating and technology that detects it. However, the present findings demonstrate that it is at least possible to deploy technical solutions in this context. Looking ahead, as various AI-methods become legitimate tools and are more seamlessly integrated into almost every aspect of daily life, it is unlikely that purely technical solutions will suffice. Instead, guidelines surrounding academic integrity will have to adapt to new conceptualizations of academic mastery and creative output. © 2024 Facultat de Psicologia, Ciencies de l'Educacio i de l'Esport Blanquerna.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate content such as texts, images, videos, sounds, etc. While GenAI tools have been utilized in various contexts, their utilization in the academic context is still a controversial topic. Scholars observed that many universities have banned GenAI due to the potential for unethical usage. In this opinion article, we promote the utilization of GenAI tools as feedback agents to alleviate challenges in conventional feedback provision. Feedback is a valuable learning source, especially in writing instructions. However, conventional feedback provision is challenging due to the increase in teacher’s workload and social irritation issues in peer feedback. Utilized ethically, GenAI tools can alleviate these challenges. A few critical considerations are briefly presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

T2  - International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction
AB  - Facial recognition technology (FRT) has become widespread in society, and its adoption in organizational settings is viewed as a natural continuation of established surveillance practices. However, concerns and resistance to FRT often arise due to controversial applications and improper use. This study contributes to the understanding of FRT in organizational contexts by conducting semi-structured interviews in a university that illustrates the larger themes of organizational justice and the ethical complexities surrounding the deployment of this technology. Drawing on organizational justice theory, we analyze users’ attitudes towards FRT deployment, their perceptions of organizational justice, and if and how the deployment adhered to or violated organizational justice principles. Our study revealed that this implementation case violated all aspects of organizational justice. Users expressed concerns regarding face capture, potential discrimination, authoritarian practices, and harm to community norms. We also provide recommendations to address organizational justice issues associated with implementing new, controversial technologies, considering technology acceptability perspectives. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T2  - Journal of Asian Public Policy
AB  - Artificial Intelligence holds vast potential in academia, yet concerns arise regarding its usage. This study examines students’ perceptions and intentions to use ChatGPT through the signalling and elaboration likelihood model, which offers valuable insights into the transmission and procession of information. Two adoption approaches are considered: the peripheral route involves the utilization of simple cues requiring less cognitive effort, such as credibility, content quality, and critical mass, while the central route requires a person to critically evaluate the information rooted in perceived usefulness and technical advantages. Critical reasoning and digital efficacy are examined as moderating variables. Using convenience sampling, data from 694 respondents are collected via WeChat and www.wjx.cn in China. Structural Equation Modeling reveals a significant positive impact of perceived usefulness, technical advantages, credibility, content quality, and critical mass on student perceptions and intentions to use ChatGPT for academic performance. The findings inform policymakers and educators on AI tool integration in higher education, stressing the importance of understanding student perceptions and intentions. ChatGPT’s perceived benefits and challenges underscore its influence on student performance and educational practices. This study advocates for ethical guidelines and support systems to address AI integration concerns, emphasizing critical reasoning and digital proficiency as pivotal factors. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The high performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) in examination contexts has triggered an intense debate about their applications, effects and risks. What legal aspects need to be considered when using LLM in teaching and assessment? What possibilities do language models offer? Statutes and laws are used to assess the use of LLM: – University statutes, state higher education laws, licensing regulations for doctors – Copyright Act (UrhG) – General Data Protection Regulation (DGPR) – AI Regulation (EU AI Act) LLM and AI offer opportunities but require clear university frameworks. These should define legitimate uses and areas where use is prohibited. Cheating and plagiarism violate good scientific practice and copyright laws. Cheating is difficult to detect. Plagiarism by AI is possible. Users of the products are responsible. LLM are effective tools for generating exam questions. Nevertheless, careful review is necessary as even apparently high-quality products may contain errors. However, the risk of copyright infringement with AI-generated exam questions is low, as copyright law allows up to 15% of protected works to be used for teaching and exams. The grading of exam content is subject to higher education laws and regulations and the GDPR. Exclusively computer-based assessment without human review is not permitted. For high-risk applications in education, the EU's AI Regulation will apply in the future. When dealing with LLM in assessments, evaluation criteria for existing assessments can be adapted, as can assessment programmes, e.g. to reduce the motivation to cheat. LLM can also become the subject of the examination themselves. Teachers should undergo further training in AI and consider LLM as an addition. © 2024 März et al.

AB  - The advent of Chat-GPT, an AI-driven technology, is reshaping various sectors, particularly higher education. This study, merging the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), explores the relationship between technology adoption and protection motivation in higher education, addressing the concept of “the (un)knowledgeable, the (un)skilled.” Through Structural Equation Modeling, findings from Indonesian participants (N = 445), including students and lecturers, reveal that perceived benefits such as task efficiency, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy predominantly motivate Chat-GPT use. Risk perception leans more on perceived vulnerability than severity, with insignificant impact from response cost. Response efficacy and self-efficacy significantly determine intention. Insight from moderating effect of educational level suggest that doctoral-level users demonstrate increased Chat-GPT usage, and gender plays a role in response efficacy and task efficiency. Both educational level and gender actively influence users’ intentions and actual usage behavior. These insights guide educators, policymakers, and institutions in ethically integrating AI, managing evolving risk perceptions, and empowering users in the dynamic AI landscape of higher education. Policymakers (e.g., university boards) are urged to dexterity an ethical framework and authorize in user efficacy to ensure equitable access and benefits from Chat-GPT in education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Assessing law students has always been a challenging task, but the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, compounds the problems already caused by increased student numbers, contract cheating and budget cuts in universities. As GenAI rapidly develops, legal educators must find ways to accommodate, and even incorporate, GenAI into their curricula and assessments so that law graduates can understand its capabilities and limitations within legal practice. Simultaneously, many jurisdictions, including Australia, have legislative obligations to deliver law graduates who satisfy legal knowledge-based “eligibility” requirements for admission into practice. This article introduces a knowledge framework for managing GenAI in legal education consisting of three pillars: Substantive Legal Knowledge, GenAI Ethics Knowledge, and GenAI System Knowledge. The authors argue this framework can assist legal educators in designing optimal assessments in an AI-disrupted world. The article employs the knowledge framework to examine the experiences and views of Australian law students’ engagement with GenAI outputs in completing a compulsory legal ethics assessment in 2023. This empirical case study demonstrates that effective assessment design incorporating GenAI can enhance law student and graduate outcomes despite the ongoing challenges for legal educators and the profession associated with GenAI. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Detecting plagiarism, which is crucial for upholding institutional credibility, is a persistent and growing challenge for university faculty. The recent emergence of AI language models like ChatGPT introduces a new complication for faculty: discerning whether students have used AI in the production of their course work. Until AI detection software becomes effective at revealing the presence and the extent of the contributions made by AI to student submissions, the ability of faculty to detect, by either expertise or intuition, whether text is generated primarily by AI or student effort, is an important topic for exploration. We investigated faculty members' ability to differentiate paragraphs written by students from those generated by ChatGPT. One group of students used ChatGPT, while another wrote essays without AI assistance. We collected student essays and distributed random samples to 27 faculty members of an English department, 19 of whom responded to a questionnaire in which they reported their beliefs about which texts were written by students and which texts written by AI, and indicated the reasons underlying those beliefs. Faculty were generally successful in identifying ChatGPT-generated content using their expertise and intuition. Linguistic cues, such as syntactic structures, language idiosyncrasies, and contextual coherence gaps were commonly cited as explanations for their decisions. © 2024, Editorial Board English Scholarship Beyond Borders.

AB  - ChatGPT, a chatbot based on a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, can be used as a teaching tool in the educational setting, providing text in an interactive way. However, concerns point out risks and disadvantages, as possible incorrect or irrelevant answers, privacy concerns, and copyright issues. This study aims to categorize the strategies used by undergraduate students completing a source-based writing task (SBW, i.e., written production based on texts previously read) with the help of ChatGPT and their relation to the quality and content of students’ written products. ChatGPT can be educationally useful in SBW tasks, which require the synthesis of information from a text in response to a prompt. SBW requires mastering writing conventions and an accurate understanding of source material. We collected 27 non-expert users of ChatGPT and writers (Mage = 20.37; SD = 2.17). We administered a sociodemographic questionnaire, an academic writing motivation scale, and a measure of perceived prior knowledge. Participants were given a source-based writing task with access to ChatGPT as external aid. They performed a retrospective think-aloud interview on ChatGPT use. Data showed limited use of ChatGPT due to limited expertise and ethical concerns. The level of integration of conflicting information showed to not be associated with the interaction with ChatGPT. However, the use of ChatGPT showed a negative association with the amount of literal source-text information that students include in their written product. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence Meeting Assistants (AIMAs) in enhancing student engagement and satisfaction in English-medium university lectures in Hong Kong, China. Otter.ai, known for its real-time transcription capabilities, was implemented in two mandatory English course sessions for first-year students. Student feedback was collected through post-lecture surveys. Preliminary analyses reveal an encouraging impact on the anticipated performance of students using the AIMA, with those in the AIMA group reporting statistically higher expected grades compared to the non-AIMA group. However, perceived instructor enthusiasm and communication skills and clarity of presentation are noted to be lower for the AIMA group. This research underscores both the potential benefits and challenges linked with AIMA usage in an academic context. By illuminating these aspects and identifying areas for improvement in AIMA implementation, this study contributes to bridging the gap between AI technology and its practical application in education. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of Asian Public Policy
AB  - Considering the opportunities and challenges raised by generative AI (GenAI) technologies, many universities have been developing policies to guide the integration of GenAI in their academic community. Focusing on Asian universities, this paper presents a scoping review of policy development regarding the GenAI integration. Guided by the theoretical framework of technology integration, this study examined the GenAI policies of 30 universities from the QS top 60 Asian universities with inductive content analysis. The review reveals that these policies prioritized text generation applications, student management, and academic integrity, suggesting an effort to uphold traditional academic values and encourage informed adoption. While the universities were at different stages of understanding and managing GenAI, they tended towards a comprehensive approach in formatting their guidance for internal stakeholders and assessment policies. The review also uncovered gaps in policymaking, such as the exclusion of non-academic staff, limited use of evidence-based practices, international misalignments, and a strong adherence to traditional academic paradigms. This scoping review provides a comprehensive and multifaceted overview of policy development in Asian universities, laying the groundwork for global discussions about the role of GenAI in higher education. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - While AI has the potential to streamline assessment development in higher education, there are concerns about its reliability, fairness, and potential to perpetuate bias. This study sought to understand the perceptions of academics and teaching and learning (T&L) specialists on the use of AI tools and large language models on assessment development, whether the private HE institution (PHEI) needs to change how it assesses students, and the types of assessments to be created. This topic is extremely relevant, as many higher education institutions (HEIs) are entering unchartered territory, and there is scant credible evidence on the prior-implementation reporting and evaluation of AI integration into assessment practices. Forty academics and T&L specialists at a PHEI in South Africa shared their perceptions. The study revealed two key themes: (a) AI use and (b) reconceptualizing assessments and T&L structures, indicating the need for HEIs to understand the synergies between AI and assessment practices. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the critical intersections of AI, academic integrity, and disability in the context of a large undergraduate course. Our aim was to adapt the course to respond to generative AI (GenAI) to avoid entrenching barriers for students, and instead teach them how to use GenAI tools in ways that deepen their learning and uphold academic honesty. Grounded in disability justice and access pedagogies, we outline five design goals centered on guidelines for AI usage, education on responsible AI use, revised assessments, support for teaching assistants (TAs), and accessible materials. These activities are detailed in our methodology. In our findings, we provide a critical reflection of the course adaptation, taking up issues such as varying levels of familiarity with GenAI, students’ capacity to engage with course changes, resistance to GenAI, instructors’ relational shifts to AI, and feelings of demoralization among the teaching team. We conclude by offering practical recommendations for educators, calling for learning communities to view this disruption as an invitation to listen to disabled students. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The technological innovation of open artificial intelligence (AI) brings more free and convenient resources for university students, and Information Engineering (IE) students have priority skills to enjoy, which may challenge their honest behavior. This study is one of the few cross-institution empirical studies in the Chinese context and 447 IE samples from five public universities are included in the quantitative research to investigate the effects of attitude, and intention on behavior toward academic misconduct (AM). The structural equation modeling technique was used to test the developed hypotheses, bootstrapping, and confidence intervals to test the mediating effect. It demonstrated that attitude was a significant predictive variable of intention and intention had a statistically significant effect on AM behavior, in which, the effect of attitudes factor on IE students’ engagement in AM behavior was mediated by intention. Pre-event educational intervention, monitoring AI technical support, and post-violation punishment are essential to help engineering students establish correct attitudes to resist the temptation of AM behavior and promote the sustainable development of engineering education. © 2024 Tempus Publications.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained massive interest with the public release of the conversational AI “ChatGPT, ” but it also has become a matter of concern for academia as it can easily be misused. We performed a quantitative evaluation of the performance of ChatGPT on a medical physiology university examination. Forty-one answers were obtained with ChatGPT and compared to the results of 24 students. The results of ChatGPT were significantly better than those of the students; the median (IQR) score was 75% (66–84%) for the AI compared to 56% (43–65%) for students (P < 0.001). The exam success rate was 100% for ChatGPT, whereas 29% (n ¼ 7) of students failed. ChatGPT could promote plagiarism and intellectual laziness among students and could represent a new and easy way to cheat, especially when evaluations are performed online. Considering that these powerful AI tools are now freely available, scholars should take great care to construct assessments that really evaluate student reflection skills and prevent AI-assisted cheating. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The release of the conversational artificial intelligence (AI) ChatGPT has become a matter of concern for academia as it can easily be misused by students for cheating purposes. We performed a quantitative evaluation of the performance of ChatGPT on a medical physiology university examination and observed that ChatGPT outperforms medical students obtaining significantly better grades. Scholars should therefore take great care to construct assessments crafted to really evaluate the student reflection skills and prevent AI-assisted cheating. 1043-4046/24 Copyright © 2024 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This mixed-methods study aims to examine factors influencing academicians’ intentions to continue using AI-based chatbots by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and social network characteristics. Background AI-powered chatbots are gaining popularity across industries, including academia. However, empirical research on academicians’ adoption behavior is limited. This study proposes an integrated model incorporating TTF factors and social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness to understand academics’ continuance intentions. Methodology A qualitative study involving 31 interviews of academics from India examined attitudes and the potential role of social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness in adoption. Results showed positive sentiment towards chatbots and themes on how peer groups accelerate diffusion. In the second phase, a survey of 448 faculty members from prominent Indian universities was conducted to test the proposed research model. Contribution The study proposes and validates an integrated model of TTF and social network factors that influence academics’ continued usage intentions toward AI chatbots. It highlights the nuanced role of peer networks in shaping adoption. Findings Task and technology characteristics positively affected academics’ intentions to continue AI chatbot usage. Among network factors, density showed the strongest effect on TTF and perceived usefulness, while homophily and connectedness had partial effects. The study provides insights into designing appropriate AI tools for the academic context. Recommendations AI chatbot designers should focus on aligning features to academics’ task for Practitioners needs and preferences. Compatibility with academic work culture is critical. Given peer network influences, training and demonstrations to user groups can enhance adoption. Platforms should have capabilities for collaborative use. Targeted messaging customized to disciplines can resonate better with academic subgroups. Multidisciplinary influencers should be engaged. Concerns like plagiarism risks, privacy, and job impacts should be transparently addressed. Recommendations More studies are needed across academic subfields to understand nuanced for Researchers requirements and barriers. Further studies are recommended to investigate differences across disciplines and demographics, relative effects of specific network factors like size, proximity, and frequency of interaction, the role of academic leadership and institutional policies in enabling chatbot adoption, and how AI training biases impact usefulness perceptions and ethical issues. Impact on Society Increased productivity in academia through the appropriate and ethical use of AI can enhance quality, access, and equity in education. AI can assist in mundane tasks, freeing academics’ time for higher-order objectives like critical thinking development. Responsible AI design and policies considering socio-cultural aspects will benefit sustainable growth. With careful implementation, it can make positive impacts on student engagement, learning support, and research efficiency. Future Research Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impacts of AI chatbot usage in academia. Track usage behaviors over time as familiarity develops. Investigate differences across academic disciplines and roles. Requirements may vary for humanities versus STEM faculty or undergraduate versus graduate students. Assess user trust in AI and how it evolves with repeated usage, and examine trust-building strategies. Develop frameworks to assess pedagogical effectiveness and ethical risks of conversational agents in academic contexts.

TI  - Using artificial intelligence platforms to support student learning in physiology
AU  - Favero, T.G.
T2  - Advances in Physiology Education
AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language models presents new opportunities and challenges in education. By teaching students how to craft prompts that elicit insightful responses, faculty can scaffold activities where AI acts as a supplemental resource to amplify critical thinking and support student learning. Ongoing dialogue and iteration focused on ethical usage norms can achieve the right balance between emerging technology and foundational skills development. With care and intention, AI-assisted study tactics offer students personalized support while adhering to academic standards. While AI-powered tools provide many positive opportunities, students and faculty need to learn about and use them responsibly and ethically, not as replacements for required thinking and effort.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 has created a crisis in tertiary education sectors worldwide with significant impacts in Malaysia. It gives the challenge to students to cope with their new learning setup. However, with the help of technology such as AI chatbot, students can receive instant assistance in seeking and accessing information and limit the disruptions during online classes. Furthermore, the advancements in AI technology have led to improvements in natural language processing, enabling chatbots to engage in more natural interactions and provide better visual and audio representations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine students’ acceptance on the effectiveness of AI chatbots to solve virtual class issues. The factors involved in this process were identified and include perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived security. A total of 376 responses were taken into this study, and the data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results indicated that higher education authorities should focus on the effectiveness of AI chatbot by its perceived ease of use which has the highest significance value followed by perceived usefulness and perceived security as the less significance value. Findings were proved by testing through Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression. University authorities should provide students with basic techniques for learning, as well as sufficient understanding and teaching about the system's capabilities, which can help students' confidence in and willingness to adopt the technology.

T2  - Journal of Criminal Justice Education
AB  - OpenAI’s ChatGPT is an advanced large language model AI that has caused both excitement and concern in academia. TurnItIn and similar software programs are widely used in higher education to detect potential plagiarism. However, the extent to which such software can identify papers produced by ChatGPT remains unclear. The current study partially addressed this question by submitting five versions of short essays about criminological topics generated from ChatGPT to the TurnItIn software. Overall, the results indicated that TurnItIn adequately detected that the essays were not original works (mean percent plagiarized score = 31%). The analyses further illustrated that ChatGPT wrote at an exceedingly high level (mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 15.1) atypical of essays in higher education. Consequently, it appears that detection of AI-generated writing may be easier than initially assumed although the technology is bound to improve. Accordingly, possible strategies for approaching AI in higher education are proposed. © 2024 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

TI  - Redesigning Tertiary Educational Evaluation with AI: A Task-Based Analysis of LIS Students’ Assessment on Written Tests and Utilizing ChatGPT at NSTU
AU  - Yesmin, S.
T2  - Science and Technology Libraries
AB  - The AI tool ChatGPT has shaken the academic system and challenges conventional teaching-learning methods. Using a mixed method approach, the author adopted a task-based analysis to measure the Library and Information Science (LIS) students’ academic performance and integrity during the Artificial Intelligence, especially the ChatGPT trend. A group of 32 LIS final-year students were purposively selected as they completed all the basic courses of their discipline. A one-day session was divided into two phases–a written exam and an assignment through ChatGPT–held at the Institute of Information Sciences (IIS), Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU). Both examinations were administered using a questionnaire including a series of 15 tasks. A faculty member of IIS was tasked with reviewing the gathered answer scripts voluntarily. Results showed that it is too difficult to rank students’ positions based on ChatGPT-generated tasks, as the participant who placed in 20th position (scored 5 out of 30) among 32 in the written examination, placed in 2nd position (scored 25) in ChatGPT-generated assignment. It is encouraging that the similarity indices (by Turnitin) reached up to 89%, which is unacceptable under university regulations. However, none of these assignments included in-text citations and references, which is questionable from the standpoint of academic ethics. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Online learning has become increasingly popular, making the learning process more attractive. One of the most popular learning media is artificial intelligence (AI). However, students do not accept this technology at all. Therefore, this study examined the factors influencing accounting students' acceptance of AI in learning. The survey was conducted with 147 higher-education students who use AI as a learning medium. The data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 with the partial least square approach. The results showed that perceived usefulness influenced behavioral intention to use and satisfaction. However, perceived ease of use was only significant for satisfaction. Similarly, perceived confidence must be consistent with intention. Although it may influence perceived usefulness, other constructs, such as AI quality and personal innovativeness, can increase students' perceptions of the benefits and convenience of adopting AI in learning. Thus, this study contributes to the development of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information systems success model and is helpful to scholars, especially in applying AI in learning. They need to pay attention to the quality of AI, such as the accuracy of the information produced. Thus, the need to control the information from the AI only serves as a reference without requiring you to trust it completely. © 2024 The Author(s).

TI  - A critical review of GenAI policies in higher education assessment: a call to reconsider the “originality” of students’ work
AU  - Luo, J.
T2  - Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education
AB  - This study offers a critical examination of university policies developed to address recent challenges presented by generative AI (GenAI) to higher education assessment. Drawing on Bacchi’s ‘What’s the problem represented to be’ (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student’s independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students’ work is required. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The rapid proliferation of the Internet has sparked a resurgence of attention toward the function of novel artificial intelligence technologies in the higher education. The effective adoption of recent advancements in human-computer interaction is crucial for inclusive education and innovation, resulting in sustainable socioeconomic growth and development. Therefore, the present investigation focuses to examine various factors that exert an influence on acceptance and use of ChatGPT by marketing students. The research’s significance lies in the integrating the concept of system flexibility into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. An adapted questionnaire was administered to gather information, and statistical procedures were conducted on 309 valid responses. The study’s results revealed that habit was the most significant predictor of behavioral intention, with performance expectancy and effort expectancy following closely behind. However, the research shows that perceived risk is not a vital factor for marketing students, as they exhibit a heightened sense of control in regulating their online behavior. Besides, the implications presented in this study hold great significance for policymakers, educators, and top-level management personnel within higher education institutions to evaluate and update existing education policies to accommodate the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT into higher education. © 2024 Society for Marketing Advances.

TI  - Academic integrity surrounding the use of generative AI in higher education: Lenses from ICT college students
AU  - Plecerda, L.P.
T2  - Environment and Social Psychology
AB  - The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) in education marks a transformative shift in teaching, learning, and assessment practices. GenAI technologies have evolved from being simple conversational agents to highly advanced systems capable of generating human-like text, solving complex problems, assisting in creative writing, tutoring, and even providing personalized feedback to students. This paper explored the use of GenAI in education with emphasis on its implications towards academic integrity. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) college students (n=30) were purposively sampled to be interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions about the use of GenAI in their program. Thematic analysis was carried out to identify emerging themes and assess the implications of GenAI use in education, particularly ICT learning processes. Students believed that GenAI offers significant benefits, such as personalized learning, assistance in creative writing, tutoring, coding, and grading, which enhance students’ learning experiences by providing instant feedback and helping them understand difficult concepts. Concerns about over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty have emerged, as some students use AI tools to bypass intellectual effort, raising questions about the authenticity of their work. ICT students expressed concerns about GenAI fostering cheating and undermining academic independence. Despite these issues, students remain optimistic about GenAI’s role in education, advocating for clear guidelines on its appropriate use to balance its benefits with the need for academic integrity. The integration of GenAI in educational settings necessitates careful management to ensure that it supports, rather than diminishes, the learning process. © 2024 by author(s).

TI  - Factors Affecting Faculty Members’ Readiness to Integrate Artificial Intelligence into Their Teaching Practices: A Study from the Saudi Higher Education Context
AU  - Alnasib, B.N.M.
T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for about three decades. However, use of AI in pedagogy on a large scale and examination of its impact on teaching practices in higher education are under-researched topics. This study examined the readiness of 465 faculty members at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia to integrate AI into their teaching practices as well as the factors influencing that readiness. A 46-item online survey was used to collect data. The results show that the respondents demonstrated an average readiness to integrate AI into their teaching (M = 3.40, SD = 0.841). Statistically significant correlations were found at the 0.01 significance level between faculty members’ readiness to incorporate AI into teaching and the perceived benefit of AI in higher education and teaching; attitudes towards AI; behavioral intentions to use AI; and facilitative conditions for AI use. Significant differences were found at the 0.05 significance level regarding faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI into their teaching according to gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no statistically significant differences were found at the 0.05 significance level in terms of faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI into their teaching according to college type or academic rank. Thus, it is recommended that faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI and their knowledge of and skills concerning AI and how to use it to improve educational institution outcomes be enhanced. © 2023 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning, and consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, there has been very little academic literature published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It explores several key themes, including university responses, academic integrity concerns, the limitations and weaknesses of AI tool outputs, and opportunities for student learning. The data reveals mixed public discussion and university responses, with a focus mainly on academic integrity concerns and opportunities for innovative assessment design. There has also been a lack of public discussion about the potential for ChatGPT to enhance participation and success for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the student voice is poorly represented in media articles to date. This article considers these trends and the impact of AI tools on student learning at university. © 2023.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence, Academic Misconduct, and the Borg Why GPT-3 Text Generation in the Higher Education Classroom is Becoming Scary
AU  - McIlwraith, T.
AU  - Finnis, E.
AU  - Jones, S.
T2  - Anthropologica
AB  - We explore playfully the capacity of an artificial intelligence text generation engine called GPT-3 to produce credible academic texts. Departing from a concern raised by colleagues about the possibility of using GPT-3 to cheat in academia, particularly at the undergraduate level, we interact with the GPT-3 interface as nerdy novices to learn what it could produce. The outputs from the GPT-3 text generation engine are incredible, at times surprising, and often terrible. We point to ways in which GPT-3 might be used by students to produce written work and reasons why most instructors, most of the time, could see through what GPT-3 has produced (at least for now). In our experiments, we learn that GPT-3 can be a productive collaborator in paper design but wonder if this is ethical. In short, while fun and somewhat addictive to experiment with, we must pay attention to the potential ways that AI text generation may begin to appear in the anthropology classroom. © 2023 University of Toronto.

TI  - ‘Words are Flowing Out Like Endless Rain Into a Paper Cup’: ChatGPT & Law School Assessments
AU  - Hargreaves, S.
T2  - Legal Education Review
AB  - ChatGPT is a sophisticated large-language model able to answer high-level questions in a way that is does not trigger conventional plagiarism detectors. Concerns have been raised that and similar forms of ‘generative AI’ pose a significant threat to academic integrity in higher education. To evaluate this risk in the context of legal education specifically, this project had ChatGPT (using the GPT3.5 model available in January 2023) generate answers to twenty-four different exams from an English-language law school based in a common law jurisdiction. It found that the system performed best on exams that were essay-based and asked students to discuss international legal instruments or general legal principles not necessarily specific to any jurisdiction. It performed worst on exams that featured problem-style or “issue spotting” questions asking students to apply an invented factual scenario to local legislation or jurisprudence. While the project suggests that for the most part conventional law school assessments are for the time being relatively immune from the threat generative AI brings, the project provides only a baseline snapshot of how large-language models tackle assessment in higher education. As both the technology improves and students learn how to harness it, increasingly fewer forms of assessment will be beyond its reach. However, rather than attempt to block students from using AI as part of learning and assessment, this paper instead proposes three ways students may be taught to use it in appropriate and ethical ways. While it is clear that generative AI will change how universities teach and assess (across disciplines), a solution of prevention or denial is no solution at all. © 2023, Australasian Law Academics Association.

T2  - Brazilian Journal of Occupational Therapy
AB  - Public access to artificial intelligence, and specifically to ChatGPT, is presenting challenges in the professional training of occupational therapists. In this context, this essay aims to describe the impact of artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on ChatGPT, on the training of occupational therapists and proposes strategies to integrate these technologies into higher education from an integrative, ethical perspective, in line with the values and principles of academic integrity. While this tool can be used to provide theoretical knowledge and enhance content learning, it also poses a risk for dishonest behaviors in the academic realm. Therefore, it is essential that educators understand its use and promote experiential methodologies that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and reflection. The challenge lies in the implementation of policies and strategies that promote the development of professional skills and the ethical and effective use of these technologies in training future occupational therapists, such as declaring its use in written works, modeling by teachers, and integration into training methodologies. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

TI  - Navigating the Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: An Analysis of Seven Global AI Ethics Policies
AU  - Slimi, Z.

T2  - TEM Journal
AB  - AI use in higher education raises ethical concerns that must be addressed. Biased algorithms pose a significant threat, especially if used in admission or grading processes, as they could have devastating effects on students. Another issue is the displacement of human educators by AI systems, and there are concerns about transparency and accountability as AI becomes more integrated into decision-making processes. This paper examined three AI objectives related higher education: biased algorithms, AI and decision-making, and human displacement. Discourse analysis of seven AI ethics policies was conducted, including those from UNESCO, China, the European Commission, Google, MIT, Sanford HAI, and Carnegie Mellon. The findings indicate that stakeholders must work together to address these challenges and ensure responsible AI deployment in higher education while maximizing its benefits. Fair use and protecting individuals, especially those with vulnerable characteristics, are crucial. Gender bias must be avoided in algorithm development, learning data sets, and AI decision-making. © 2023 Zouhaier Slimi & Beatriz Villarejo Carballido; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Due to COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face teaching has been replaced by online education to reduce the risks of spreading the Coronavirus. Online examination is an important asset in the context of online learning to assess students, but observing students during testing and ensuring that they do not engage in misbehavior remains a major issue. Human observation is one of the most common methods when conducting an exam to ensure that students do not perform any unexpected behaviors, by entering the student in a laboratory or hall at the university and observing him throughout the exam period visually and soundly. However, this method is costly and labor-intensive. In this paper, a system is created that monitors students during an online test automatically based on face recognition and voice recognition using a machine learning algorithm. The camera on the student's computer will be used to track the student's facial movements, pupils, and lip movements, monitoring the student's behavior throughout the test, and stopping any unexpected behavior. In this system, there are two parts: facial recognition and unexpected behavior detection. The face was recognized with an accuracy of 98.3%, and unexpected behavior was detected with an accuracy of 97.6%. There is also an opportunity to increase accuracy by improving the quality of the images in the dataset. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

AB  - In recent times, higher education has seen a growing concern regarding the utilisation of artificial intelligence, especially with the emergence of ChatGPT. This technology can generate written content and respond to queries at a level that is nearly indistinguishable from a human writer. This feature has drawn substantial interest from students in higher education and has led to concern that students will use ChatGPT’s capabilities to cheat on written formative and summative assessments. In this paper, we will review the usage of ChatGPT in higher education assessments and investigate why students want to cheat using artificial intelligence capabilities. It also offers a critical perspective on the challenges associated with detecting ChatGPT-generated content and its impact on academic integrity. We also consider whether artificial intelligence provides more opportunities for academics to focus on assessing higher-order thinking and strategies. © 2023. Kelum A.A. Gamage, Shyama C. P.

AB  - The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat in higher education shows excellent potential for transformation. However, this integration also raises issues in maintaining academic integrity and preventing plagiarism. In this study, we investigate and analyze practical approaches for efficiently harnessing the potential of GAI while simultaneously ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. Despite the potential to expedite the learning process and improve accessibility, concerns regarding academic misconduct highlight the necessity for the implementation of novel GAI frameworks for higher education. To effectively tackle these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, PAIGE (Promoting Assignment Integrity using Generative AI in Education). This framework emphasizes the ethical integration of GAI, promotes active student interaction, and cultivates opportunities for peer learning experiences. Higher education institutions can effectively utilize the PAIGE framework to leverage the promise of GAI while ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. This approach paves the way for a responsible and thriving future in Generative AI-driven education. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by AIMS, LLC.

AB  - Figure 1 was what was generated when we asked ChatGPT, the generative AI system that has been the subject of a thousand hot takes about how it’s disrupting academia-as-we-know-it, to describe itself for an academic librarian audience. Perhaps it’s learning a bit too much from the public relations documents that were a part of the vast amounts of data it was trained on, when it describes itself as “highly relevant,” “invaluable,” and “accurate.” It did not, however, bring up the caveat that greets you when you open up ChatGPT itself: that it “may occasionally generate incorrect information,” that it “may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content,” or that it has “limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021.” In addition, it doesn’t bring up the reddest of academic red flags—that ChatGPT provides an easy way for students to cheat and plagiarize. The Atlantic has claimed that because of ChatGPT and other AI, “the undergraduate essay [which] has been at the center of humanistic pedagogy for generations . . . is about to be disrupted from the ground up.” A writer at Times Higher Education has suggested that allowing AI to replace a student’s creative voice means “abandoning our responsibilities as educators.” © 2023 Amy B.

AB  - An anthropogenic global catastrophic risk is a human-induced risk that threatens sustained and wide-scale loss of life and damage to civilisation across the globe. In order to understand how new research on governance mechanisms for emerging technologies might assuage such risks, it is important to ask how perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes towards the governance of global catastrophic risk within the research community shape the conduct of potentially risky research. The aim of this study is to deepen our understanding of emerging technology research culture as it relates to global catastrophic risks, and to shed new light on how new research governance mechanisms might be developed. We analyse in-depth interviews with leading AI and biotech researchers both from universities and the private sector. We develop new insights in terms of four salient themes. First, ‘engineering mindset’, which highlights the premium placed by many interviewees on pursuing interesting research about the physical world for its own sake. Second, ‘self-government’, which looks at how self-regulation of technological development currently occurs. Third, ‘pure incentives’, focussing on how career and other incentives shapes research. Fourth, ‘norms and persuasion’, which examines the role of moral considerations in guiding the research choices of scientists. We end by considering the implications of these findings for future research on governance of anthropogenic global catastrophic risk. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Oral presentation is a popular type of assessment in undergraduate degree programs. However, presentation delivery and grading pose considerable challenges to students and faculty alike. For the former, many students who learn English as an additional language may fear giving oral presentations in English due to a lack of confidence. For the latter, faculty who teach multiple classes and have many students may find it difficult to spend adequate time helping students refine their communication skills. This study examines an AI-assisted presentation platform that was built to offer students more opportunities for presentation training without the need for faculty intervention. Surveys with students and teachers were conducted to inform the design of the platform. After a preliminary platform was developed, two methods were employed to evaluate its reliability: a beta test with 24 students and a comparison of AI and human scoring of the presentation performance of 36 students. It was found that students are highly receptive to the platform, but there are noticeable differences between AI and human scoring abilities. The results reveal some limitations of AI and human raters, and emphasize the potential benefit of exploring collaborative AI–human intelligence. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become more common in everyday life. AI has been used in the creation of art, music, and, most concerning to academia, writing. Advances in computing speed have only increased the adaptability of AI, but how do users take advantage of this technology in a responsible way? AI technologies such as ChatGPT allow users to create written works that can be used in college assignments. Academia should be aware of this possibility and make ethical decisions on how to approach AI as it becomes more commonplace. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - In this article we start with elaborating the educational and cultural setting of the use of computers in general and of the additional impact of the ChatGPT in these. Their impact is changing the assessment of education in general. It is crucial to be aware of the related challenges when looking and studying ChatGPT. With this in mind we describe a case study involving the use of ChatGPT in elearning. The aim of this study is to gather usability impressions from system interactions during an e-learning session related to the domain of knowledge representation. This concerns in particular the aspects of fluency, understandability of the responses, and the adequacy of the provided knowledge. These aspects form the first part of the article, and in the second part we look at a broader range of related topics including the technologies behind ChatGPT, a literature study of the encountered ChatGPT limitations and errors, and the implied need of critical thinking when using ChatGPT. Moreover, key ethical aspects of using ChatGPT are discussed, and also state-of-the-art online tools concerning automatic detection of AI generated content. Our findings concerning the potential use of ChatGPT in e-learning are confirmed by the presented literature study. © 2023, ICIWO vzw. All rights reserved.

AB  - In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Distance learning has spread nowadays on a large scale across the world, which has led to many challenges in education such as invigilation and learning coordination. These challenges have attracted the attention of many researchers aiming at providing high quality and credibility monitoring of students. Distance learning has offered an effective education alternative to traditional learning in higher education. The lecturers in universities face difficulties in understanding students’ emotions and abnormal behaviors during educational sessions and e-exams. The purpose of this study is to use computer vision algorithms and deep learning algorithms to develop a new system that supports lecturers in monitoring and managing students during online learning sessions and e-exams. To achieve the proposed objective, the system employs software methods, computer vision algorithms, and deep learning algorithms. Semi-structural interviews were also used as feedback to enhance the system. The findings showed that the system achieved high accuracy for student identification in real time, student follow-up during the online session, and cheating detection. Future work can focus on developing additional tools to assist students with special needs and speech recognition to improve the follow-up facial recognition system’s ability to detect cheating during e-exams in distance learning. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In August 2020, students took to the streets of London in a mass protest over their A-level results (that determine entry to university), chanting 'F∗ck the algorithm.' Their A-level grades had been determined by an algorithm that depended on past school performance, a system of teacher ratings, and for smaller student groups, the use of Centre Assessed Grades. Commendably Ofqual (the U.K. Government Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) were transparent in their use of the algorithm so that affected stakeholders were informed of the algorithm's existence and the key details of how it was developed. The design of the data set produced an algorithm with biased outputs, which hardcoded preexisting educational, policy, and societal biases. Due to the large numbers of students, the single 'results day' output and the wider interests of schools, teachers, parents, and universities, the unfairness of the outcome was magnified. Add to this that the students were, by definition, academically proficient individuals, many of whom derived from privileged and supportive backgrounds, which meant that they had the awareness and capacity to challenge. Hence, the impact of this biased algorithm was not received silently and so it was hard to deny, deflect, and dismiss. However, this is not always the case, and many systems are deployed with similar biases and harmful outcomes but the impact is dissipated over time and individuals, and therefore not so immediately obvious and easy to challenge. This is particularly the case when the people impacted do not have the advantages that enabled the A-level students to challenge. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Contract cheating, a form of academic misconduct in which students outsource assessment activities to third parties, is a topic of concern among educators. As similarity-detection systems are ineffective at detecting contract cheating, some institutions have turned to intensely criticised proctoring systems, however student and educator bodies report high costs and privacy concerns. Oral assessment is an alternative assessment approach that provides valuable interpersonal and communication skills in graduates and can naturally help detect and deter cheating. However, oral assessment is typically time-consuming, and in larger courses, it is challenging to validate respondents' identity. Advancements in machine learning approaches can scale time-consuming tasks that previously required prohibitive educator effort. One such system, Deep Speaker, is a speaker identification and verification system that can verify if two audio samples resemble speech from the same person with high accuracy. This paper presents an innovative tool that integrates an online oral assessment tool, Real Talk, with Deep Speaker. This proposed system facilitates scalable student-tutor discussions while providing longitudinal student identity validation with minimal cost and impact for institutions and addressing student privacy concerns. We evaluated the system and showed that student audio responses collected via oral discussion tools are suitable for verification. We then discuss the impact our system may have when applied in higher education. We posit that institutions can use such approaches to detect cases of contract cheating, enhance learning outcomes, and pave the way for more student-friendly assessment and discussion models in online education. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Who Will Watch the Watchmen? The Ethico-political Arrangements of Algorithmic Proctoring for Academic Integrity
AU  - Henry, J.V.

T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - Critics of artificial intelligence have suggested that the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency (FATE) have been used for ‘ethics washing’, in order to appease industrial interests. In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AU  - Fritts, M.
AU  - Cabrera, F.
T2  - Ethics and Information Technology
AB  - According to a recent survey by the HR Research Institute, as the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common in the workplace, HR professionals are worried that the use of recruitment algorithms will lead to a “dehumanization” of the hiring process. Our main goals in this paper are threefold: (i) to bring attention to this neglected issue, (ii) to clarify what exactly this concern about dehumanization might amount to, and (iii) to sketch an argument for why dehumanizing the hiring process is ethically suspect. After distinguishing the use of the term “dehumanization” in this context (i.e. removing the human presence) from its more common meaning in the interdisciplinary field of dehumanization studies (i.e. conceiving of other humans as subhuman), we argue that the use of hiring algorithms may negatively impact the employee-employer relationship. We argue that there are good independent reasons to accept a substantive employee-employer relationship, as well as an applicant-employer relationship, both of which are consistent with a stakeholder theory of corporate obligations. We further argue that dehumanizing the hiring process may negatively impact these relationships because of the difference between the values of human recruiters and the values embedded in recruitment algorithms. Drawing on Nguyen’s (in: Lackey, Applied Epistemology, Oxford University Press, 2021) critique of how Twitter “gamifies communication”, we argue that replacing human recruiters with algorithms imports artificial values into the hiring process. We close by briefly considering some ways to potentially mitigate the problems posed by recruitment algorithms, along with the possibility that some difficult trade-offs will need to be made. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Effectiveness of embodied conversational agents for managing academic stress at an Indian University (ARU) during COVID-19

T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.

T2  - Nurse Education Today
AB  - Background: Despite powerful efforts to maximize nursing school enrollment, schools and colleges of nursing are faced with high rates of attrition and low rates of completion. Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80% of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90% after the second college year and 99% after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - From responsible robotics towards a human rights regime oriented to the challenges of robotics and artificial intelligence
AU  - Liu, H.-Y.

T2  - Ethics and Information Technology
AB  - As the aim of the responsible robotics initiative is to ensure that responsible practices are inculcated within each stage of design, development and use, this impetus is undergirded by the alignment of ethical and legal considerations towards socially beneficial ends. While every effort should be expended to ensure that issues of responsibility are addressed at each stage of technological progression, irresponsibility (meaning a lack of responsibility) is inherent within the nature of robotics technologies from a theoretical perspective that threatens to thwart the endeavour. This is because the concept of responsibility, despite being treated as such, is not monolithic: rather this seemingly unified concept consists of converging and confluent concepts that shape the idea of what we colloquially call responsibility. From a different perspective, robotics will be simultaneously responsible and irresponsible depending on the particular concept of responsibility that is foregrounded: an observation that cuts against the grain of the drive towards responsible robotics. This problem is further compounded by responsible design and development as contrasted to responsible use. From a different perspective, the difficulty in defining the concept of responsibility in robotics is because human responsibility is the main frame of reference. Robotic systems are increasingly expected to achieve the human-level performance, including the capacities associated with responsibility and other criteria which are necessary to act responsibly. This subsists within a larger phenomenon where the difference between humans and non-humans, be it animals or artificial systems, appears to be increasingly blurred, thereby disrupting orthodox understandings of responsibility. This paper seeks to supplement the responsible robotics impulse by proposing a complementary set of human rights directed specifically against the harms arising from robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The relationship between responsibilities of the agent and the rights of the patient suggest that a rights regime is the other side of responsibility coin. The major distinction of this approach is to invert the power relationship: while human agents are perceived to control robotic patients, the prospect for this to become reversed is beginning. As robotic technologies become ever more sophisticated, and even genuinely complex, asserting human rights directly against robotic harms become increasingly important. Such an approach includes not only developing human rights that ‘protect’ humans (in a negative, defensive, sense) but also ‘strengthen’ people against the challenges introduced by robotics and AI (in a positive, empowering, manner) [This distinction parallels Berlin’s negative and positive concepts of liberty (Berlin, in Liberty, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002)], by emphasising the social and reflective character of the notion of humanness as well as the difference between the human and nonhuman. This will allow using the human frame of reference as constitutive of, rather than only subject to, the robotic and AI technologies, where it is human and not technology characteristics that shape the human rights framework in the first place. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - A vulnerability analysis: Theorising the impact of artificial intelligence decision-making processes on individuals, society and human diversity from a social justice perspective
AU  - Krupiy, T.T.
T2  - Computer Law and Security Review
AB  - The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation. © 2020 Tetyana (Tanya) Krupiy

AB  - Currently, universities are going through a critical moment due to the coronavirus disease in 2019. To prevent its spread, countries have declared quarantines and isolation in all sectors of society. This has caused many problems in the learning of students, since, when moving from a face-to-face educational model to a remote model, several academic factors such as psychological, financial, and methodological have been overlooked. To exactly identify the variables and causes that affect learning, in this work a data analysis model using a Hadoop framework is proposed. By processing the data, it is possible to identify and classify students to determine the problems they present in different learning activities. The results are used by an artificial intelligence system that takes student information and converts it into knowledge, evaluates the academic performance problems they present, and determines what type of activity aligns with the students. The artificial intelligence system processes the information and recommends activities that focus on each student’s abilities and needs. The integration of these systems to universities creates an adaptive educational model that responds to the new challenges of society. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

These tools were used to take passages that were copied from sources, and through various methods, disguised the original text to avoid academic integrity violations. At first, these tools were not very good and produced nearly incomprehensible output. However, through the use of generative artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the current engines supporting these tools have become better and more efficient at producing quality output. Recently, the artificial intelligence research company, OpenAI, developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence engine to drive a conversational chat frontend application called ChatGPT. Backed by an expansive knowledge base that could rival any university library in volume, this AI-driven conversational application can produce well-written, seemingly academic, responses to questions.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the role of GAI in the production of new research paying particular attention to the use of GAI in collecting new data for a doctoral dissertation. This study employed qualitative methodology examining how GAI, specifically ChatGPT, responded to interview questions from a previously published article by the researchers to determine how closely chatbots mimic responses from the actual study participants. The researchers found that data integrity in qualitative research may be at risk if higher education institutions do not set clear policies and specific parameters for how doctoral research data is obtained and validated in light of GAI.

T2  - Communication Teacher
AB  - This article offers a semester-long approach to using generative AI in the public-speaking course. Using critical communication pedagogy, the authors provide practices to navigate the turbulence that has followed the emergence of publicly available generative AI tools. These tools have received negative attention because of their potential to facilitate academic dishonesty and undermine the learning process. Despite this concern, we've chosen to embrace these tools and the transformative power they have for public-speaking curricula. Course: Public Speaking. Objectives: Create an environment of co-learning with students; formulate expectations for student use of AI; develop a reflective process for students to critically evaluate AI material; and design assignments to encourage critical thinking skills.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies have a long history of being used in education for motivating learners and enhancing learning. However, there have also been critiques for a too uncritical and naïve implementation of AI in education (AIED) and the potential misuse of the technology. With the release of the virtual assistant ChatGPT from OpenAI, many educators and stakeholders were both amazed and horrified by the potential consequences for education. One field with a potential high impact of ChatGPT is programming education in Computer Science (CS), where creating assessments has long been a challenging task due to the vast amount of programming solutions and support on the Internet. This now appears to have been made even more challenging with ChatGPT's ability to produce both complex and seemingly novel solutions to programming questions. With the support of data collected from interactions with ChatGPT during the spring semester of 2023, this position paper inv

AB  - This article presents a brief overview of the state-of-the-art in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and discusses the difficulties that these technologies create for educators with regard to assessment. Making use of the 'arms race' metaphor, this article argues that there are no simple solutions to the 'AI problem'. Rather, this author shows that educators and universities will need to adopt a complex strategy consisting of solutions at four different levels of vulnerability: Ethical, pedagogic/didactic, technological and policy. Lastly, the article presents general recommendations for addressing vulnerabilities at each of these levels.

Focusing on Generative AI and ChatGPT in particular, our study examines how AI chatbots impact university teachers' assessment practices, exploring teachers' perceptions about how ChatGPT performs in response to home examination prompts in undergraduate contexts. University teachers (n = 24) from four different departments in humanities and social sciences participated in Turing Test-inspired experiments, where they blindly assessed student and ChatGPT-written responses to home examination questions. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews in focus groups with the same teachers examining their reflections about the quality of the texts they assessed. Regarding chatbot-generated texts, we found a passing rate range across the cohort (37.5-85.7%) and a chatbot-written suspicion range (14-23%).

T2  - Information Systems Education Journal
AB  - In this paper we describe a framework for teaching students when they should, or should not use generative AI such as ChatGPT. Generative AI has created a fundamental shift in how students can complete their class assignments, and other tasks such as building resumes and creating cover letters, and we believe it is imperative that we teach students when the use of generative AI is appropriate, and when it is not appropriate (i.e., considered cheating). Framework development is based off the 2x2 Product-Market matrix introduced by Ansoff in 1965. Our initial pass at the framework was piloted with colleagues, and then followed with a focus group of students to refine the framework. We then used the framework in an MBA class to test its efficacy and gather qualitative feedback. Using the results, we further refined the framework and then used it to teach two general undergraduate business classes as a rudimentary test of generalizability across students.

In broader terms, Palestinian universities follow the traditional methods of teaching based on memorization and rote learning. These conventional teaching strategies are in stark contrast to the manner in which students engage with topics when utilizing ChatGPT. However, the use of ChatGPT has led to a noticeable declining participation in classes, increased absences, and a diminished enthusiasm for examinations–a stark departure from the value they previously placed on them.

T2  - ELT Journal
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly chatbots with speech-recognition, are gaining attention as tools for ELT. However, this frontline development in contemporary ELT seems to stand in stark contrast to the multilingual effort, another innovative trend, as chatbots' speech recognition capabilities are primarily attuned to native English speaker pronunciation. Addressing this concern, this study adopted a Global Englishes (GE) perspective and examined students' attitudes toward English after their use of a speech-recognition chatbot. Text-mining analysis of reflection papers from 38 students and thematic analysis of interviews with seven students revealed that the chatbot hindered the incorporation of diverse English use into ELT and students expressed a conception of English not as a language in flux but rather as a subject with specific content to be mastered. The findings are discussed concerning GE, AI ethics, and computer-assisted language learning, and implicat

We also aim to provide historical perspective, both on how automation and technology has generated unnecessary apprehension over time, and how generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT are a product of the discipline of cognitive science. We introduce a model for how higher education instruction can adapt to the age of AI by fully capitalizing on the role that metacognition knowledge and skills play in determining learning effectiveness. Finally, we urge educators to consider how AI can be seen as a critical collaborator to be utilized in our efforts to educate around the critical workforce skills of effective communication and collaboration.

We present the emergent framework, Students' Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students' use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students' use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.

The consequence of this contextual and knowledge gap is a lack of specific understanding regarding students' engagement with ChatGPT for academic dishonesty in Nigerian tertiary institutions. This study addressed these gaps by examining students' perceptions, attitudes, and utilisation of the ChatGPT and determining the role of sex and age in these linkages. A sample of 4679 public university students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling and multigroup analysis were performed to test the conceptual model with the aid of SmartPLS 3. The results indicated that, regardless of sex or age, students with positive perceptions of ChatGPT were more prone to use it for dishonest academic purposes.

AB  - Academic integrity concerns related to students' use of technology have renewed calls for teaching, assessment, and learning best practices, including those that involve and empower students. Empowerment is a benefit of developing students' assessment literacies, or how students contextually understand, plan, and undertake assessment and use assessment information to monitor and progress their learning. Informed by Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory and reflexivity (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1983), a qualitative exploratory case study examined first-year university students' experiences with assessment and the development of their assessment literacies. The findings highlighted student autonomy and empowerment benefits while stressing the importance of reflexivity and assessment literacies for both students and teachers. Teaching, assessment, and learning best practices commonly suggested to promote academic honesty in the GenAI context were also evident. Accordingly, this paper explo

Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work.

University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a 'black box'. Rather than seeking to explain 'black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use.

AB  - Although previous studies have highlighted the problematic artificial intelligence (AI) usage behaviors in educational contexts, such as overreliance on AI, no study has explored the antecedents and potential consequences that contribute to this problem. Therefore, this study investigates the causes and consequences of AI dependency using ChatGPT as an example. Using the Interaction of the Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, this study explores the internal associations between academic self-efficacy, academic stress, performance expectations, and AI dependency. It also identifies the negative consequences of AI dependency. Analysis of data from 300 university students revealed that the relationship between academic self-efficacy and AI dependency was mediated by academic stress and performance expectations. The top five negative effects of AI dependency include increased laziness, the spread of misinformation, a lower level of creativity, and reduced critical and indepe

AB  - Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT provide second language practice through chats in written or voice formats, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback and create practice exercises. Using AI, instructors can build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. Generative AI provides affordances for both autonomous and instructed learning. In addition, AI is poised to enhance dramatically the usefulness of immersive technologies. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their statistical model of human language, which constrains their capacity for dealing with sociocultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created and deployed, as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. Never

AB  - Machine learning methods can be used to reduce the manual workload in exam grading, making it possible for teachers to spend more time on other tasks. However, when it comes to grading exams, fully eliminating manual work is not yet possible even with very accurate automated grading, as any grading mistakes could have significant consequences for the students. Here, the evaluation of an automated grading approach is therefore extended from measuring workload in relation to the accuracy of automated grading, to also measuring the overall workload required to correctly grade a full exam, with and without the support of machine learning. The evaluation was performed during an introductory computer science course with over 400 students. The exam consisted of 64 questions with relatively short answers and a two-step approach for automated grading was applied. First, a subset of answers to the exam questions was manually graded and next used as training data for machine learning models clas

AB  - Large Language Models have already begun to affect the higher education landscape. However, there is currently a lack of work investigating how these models interface – and possibly interfere – with literacy development. Considering literacy is critical because student learning is only made possible through language. This paper considers implications for university students' literacy development by drawing on Lea and Street's academic literacies framework. I argue that LLMs pose different levels of risk for students' development of each aspect of literacy contained within the framework: study skills are least at risk, academic socialisation is most at risk, and academic literacies represent an intermediate risk. Implications for instructors include dedicated instructional time and support for students to engage with reading and writing practices without LLM support before they begin to incorporate them into their literacies repertoire. If students rely too heavily on LLMs initially,

AB  - ChatGPT and AI programs are creating a stir on college campuses nationwide. Concerns about cheating are strong and many instructors are adopting new teaching strategies to dissuade students from using the technology in assignments. In the present study, undergraduate students in an introductory epidemiology course were assigned to use ChatGPT to produce essays about topics related to course content and, in pairs, critically analyze the resulting essays. Individually, students responded to reflection questions regarding the technology and its implications for college classrooms. In this study, those qualitative reflection responses were analyzed for themes. While a variety of viewpoints were expressed regarding expectations of the program, most students were aware of the potential for cheating but remained cautiously optimistic about the use of ChatGPT as an educational tool.

Although AI makes education more accessible and efficient, the intentional misuse of AI chatbots in facilitating academic cheating has become a growing concern. By using the indirect questioning technique via a list experiment to minimize social desirability bias, this research contributes to the ongoing dialog on academic integrity in the era of AI. Our findings reveal that students conceal AI-powered academic cheating behaviors when directly questioned, as the prevalence of cheaters observed via list experiments is almost threefold the prevalence of cheaters observed via the basic direct questioning approach. Interestingly, our subsample analysis shows that AI-powered academic cheating behaviors differ significantly across genders and grades, as higher-grade female students are more likely to cheat than newly enrolled female stu

AB  - We present eight studies dealing with artificial intelligence and mobile apps that assist post-secondary students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other disabilities with their academic work. Study 1, based on an advisory board and on a Google search, provided glowing testimonials about AI tools. However, Study 2, a scoping review of the scientific literature, showed that research is scant. In Study 3 we explored how students with and without disabilities used AI-based intelligent virtual assistants to do schoolwork. Our findings show that students are not realizing the potential of these tools. In Study 4, we explored AI-based technologies used by 163 students with and 74 students without disabilities and in Study 5 we investigated AI-based technologies professors required students to use. These studies helped identify sustainable practices. In studies 6, 7 and 8 we explored apps for students with ADHD. Overall, the results show that students with and without

AB  - Purpose: In November 2022, the commercial company, OpenAI, launched ChatGPT. Since then, university students have rapidly become regular users of this artificial intelligence (AI) platform. One reason for this is the powerful capability of this generative AI tool to produce textual content, which in many cases, is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. Another reason is that ChatGPT easily gives anyone access to knowledge. However, there is a problem as the vast majority of its users have no idea how this AI platform works and thus overlook the importance of thinking critically about information communicated in ChatGPT. While some call for banning this generative AI tool, this study aims to provide evidence that science classrooms can become scenarios where students find explicit, concrete, and realistic opportunities to critically evaluate scientific information generated by ChatGPT.

AB  - Our world has been transformed by technologies incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) within mass communication, employment, entertainment and many other aspects of our daily lives. However, within the domain of education, it seems that our ways of working and, particularly, assessing have hardly changed at all. We continue to prize examinations and summative testing as the most reliable way to assess educational achievements, and we continue to rely on paper-based test delivery as our modus operandi. Inertia, tradition and aversion to perceived risk have resulted in a lack of innovation (James, 2006), particularly so in the area of high-stakes assessment. The summer of 2020 brought this deficit into very sharp focus with the A-level debacle in England, where grades were awarded, challenged, rescinded and reset. These events are potentially catastrophic in terms of how we trust national examinations, and the problems arise from using just one way to define academic success and one

T2  - Education Research and Perspectives
AB  - Effective assessments guide student learning, refine teaching practices, ensure curriculum alignment, and foster workforce readiness. However, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has significantly disrupted traditional assessment processes, raising concerns about academic integrity and necessitating innovative approaches. While higher education institutions are making strides in adapting to this new reality, the foundation of effective assessment remains educators' assessment literacy. This paper responds to the critical need for improving educators' assessment literacy by introducing a comprehensive model – the 'AARDVARC' framework – that outlines eight key attributes of effective assessment: alignment, authenticity, reliability, developmental appropriateness, validity, accessibility, realism, and constructiveness. By fostering assessment literacy, educators can design innovative, equitable, and discipline-relevant assessments that in

T2  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, so does the interest in AI ethics. To address issues related to AI ethics, many government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and corporations have published AI ethics guidelines. However, only a few test instruments have been developed to assess students' attitudes toward AI ethics. A related instrument is required to effectively prepare lecture curricula and materials on AI ethics, as well as to quantitatively evaluate the learning effect of students. In this study, we developed and validated the instrument (AT-EAI) to assess undergraduate students' attitudes toward AI ethics. The instrument's reliability, content validity, and construct validity were evaluated following its development and application in a sample of 1,076 undergraduate students. Initially, the instrument comprised five dimensions that totaled 42 items, while the final version had 17 items. When it came to content validity, experts (n = 8) were in

AB  - 18 students engaged in learning about artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT 3 (CHAT), to respond to the question of whether it is ethical or practical for students to use CHAT in college-level classrooms to complete assignments. A thematic unit was created and taught in 2 face-to-face English 101 classes to explore the topic of CHAT. The unit was created with and designed to be completed by CHAT. After reflecting on 3 readings, 2 videos, and completing various related assignments, students were expected to write a 5-page essay about CHAT using CHAT in whatever way they wanted to complete the work while still maintaining the specific requirements of the English 101 objectives. The essays were examined by the students using the same peer review process that we used for 2 essays written without using CHAT before the thematic unit, with the addition of 2 instructions: to check the veracity of the sources, and to evaluate the essays for consistency of tone, accuracy of information,

AB  - In the evolving landscape of higher education, challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the necessity for innovative teaching methodologies. These challenges have catalyzed the integration of technology into education, particularly in blended learning environments, to bolster self-regulated learning (SRL) and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, increased autonomy in blended learning can lead to learning disruptions if issues are not promptly addressed. In this context, OpenAI's ChatGPT, known for its extensive knowledge base and immediate feedback capability, emerges as a significant educational resource. Nonetheless, there are concerns that students might become excessively dependent on such tools, potentially hindering their development of HOTS. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Guidance-based ChatGPT-assisted Learning Aid (GCLA).

However, studies on TSI support tools often focus on teacher needs while neglecting student needs and autonomy. To enhance both lecturer competence in delivering interpersonal interaction and student autonomy in TSI, we developed NaMemo2, a novel augmented-reality system that allows students to express their willingness to TSI and displays student information to teachers during lectures. The design and evaluation process follows a new framework, STUDIER, which can facilitate the development of theory-based ethnics-aware TSI support tools in general. The quantitative results of our four-week field study with four classes in a university suggested that NaMemo2 can improve (1) TSI in the classroom from both teacher and student perspectives, (2) student attitudes and willingness to TSI, and (3) student attitudes to the deployment of NaMemo2.

TI  - ChatGPT Is a Game Changer: Detection and Eradication Is Not the Way Forward
AU  - Blackie, Margaret A. L.
T2  - Teaching in Higher Education
AB  - Large language models such as ChatGPT can be seen as a major threat to reliable assessment in higher education. In this point of departure, I argue that these tools are a major game changer for society at large. Many of the jobs we now consider highly skilled are based on pattern recognition that can much more reliably be carried by fine-tuned language models. We are therefore at a turning point in history and it affords a powerful opportunity to reconsider the value of higher education in the light of these tools.

AB  - The use of AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, has been widespread in recent years. Its application in education has been criticized by some and supported by others. In this article we present the case of a work carried out as part of a course unit in a computer science degree program in which the use of ChatGPT was not only encouraged but required. Students were asked to use this tool ethically and critically, comparing the results with bibliographical references. A questionnaire addressing students' perceptions about the work and ChatGPT usage was performed after delivering the task. Results showed that students were motivated to carry out the work and understood that its widespread use requires critical thinking and compliance with ethical principles. The teacher acknowledge that some students developed these competences while performing this task and were able to deliver a quality, well supported essay. The development of this competences was also identified by some students.

TI  - Student Perceptions of Academic Integrity: A Qualitative Study of Understanding, Consequences, and Impact
AU  - Stone, Anna
T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - Background: Academic integrity (AI) is of increasing importance in higher education. At the same time, students are becoming more consumer-oriented and more inclined to appeal against, or complain about, a penalty imposed for a breach of AI. This combination of factors places pressure on institutions of higher education to handle alleged breaches of AI in a way acceptable to students that motivates them to continue to engage with their studies. Method: Students (n = 8) were interviewed to discover their perceptions of the process for dealing with breaches of AI. All students were based in one university in a very diverse area of London which has many first-generation students from non-traditional academic backgrounds. Results: Students reported strong emotional reactions featuring high levels of anxiety and stress. Some found the process to be threatening and demotivating and questioned continuation on their course of study, while others used more adaptive coping strategies. Students

There although has been increasing concern about how to systematically enhance the AI applications effect, AI risk governance in HCAI education has not been discussed yet. This study adopted literature meta-analysis, along with the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods in order to establish the risk framework and calculate the index weight of HCAI education. The results confirm that the risk framework includes eight indicators, which respectively are misunderstanding of the HCAI concept (MC), misuse of AI resources (MR), mismatching of AI pedagogy (MP), privacy security risk (PSR), transparency risk (TR), accountability risk (AR), bias risk (BR), and perceived risk (PR). Meanwhile, the eight indicators are divided into four categories such as HCAI concept, application process, ethical security, and man-machine interaction. Moreover, the trend of ris

AB  - Despite the growing popularity of ChatGPT and chatbot-assisted writing, research on the use of ChatGPT in second language (L2) writing classrooms remains insufficient. Using reflection papers and focus group interviews, the qualitative study examined doctoral students' views on the impact of using ChatGPT on L2 writing and their expected responses. Thematic analysis revealed that ChatGPT could support writers at the pre-writing, during-writing and post-writing stages and serve as a self-learning tool for writing and thinking development with its human and non-human features. Nonetheless, its generative nature also gave rise to concerns for learning loss, authorial voice, unintelligent texts, academic integrity as well as social and safety risks. Based on the benefits and drawbacks, the doctoral students expected the education sector to make concerted efforts for the effective, ethical and responsible use of ChatGPT in L2 writing.

The introduction situates the advent of digital technologies in the context of the structural economic and ideological shifts of the past 40 years. Such changes include neo-liberal restructuring, the repressive school and social turn, changes in the use of positivist ideology in schooling, the role of new technologies in social and cultural reproduction and changing imperatives for capital accumulation. The article illustrates different uses of AI as part of the technological turn of public education privatization. Examples include: (1) adaptive learning technology, and transformations to teacher work and conceptions of knowledge and learning; (2) biometric pedagogy and the cultural politics of locating learning in the body; and (3) the convergence of impact investing and digital su

In this article, I look at the practicalities of AI in education and at the attendant ethical issues it raises. My key conclusion is that AI in the near- to medium-term future has the potential to enrich student learning and complement the work of (human) teachers without dispensing with them. In addition, AI should increasingly enable such traditional divides as 'school versus home' to be straddled with regard to learning. AI offers the hope of increasing personalization in education, but it is accompanied by risks of learning becoming less social. There is much that we can learn from previous introductions of new technologies in school to help maximize the likelihood tha

One example is an individual digital study assistant (IDSA) for students, which provides functionalities to train self-regulation skills, to engage with own educational goals and to offer automated, first-level support to higher education institution (HEI) units and employees. An IDSA further can guide students through HEI and their administration. But, what are the critical success factors (CSF) and challenges for an IDSA? We deduce these using a mixed methods approach with one quantitative student survey, two rounds of interviews with various HEI experts, and a literature review. We classified our results according to the information system (IS) success model of DeLone &amp; McLean (2016).

T2  - Journal of Teaching in Social Work
AB  - Artificial intelligence has evolved since its inception in the 1950s, resulting in the creation of large language models that are trained on extensive data sets to understand and generate content, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. Modern technology that is easy to access and free to use, like ChatGPT, is changing the educational landscape as it is an example of a large language model – an artificial intelligence network – that can process and generate text that reads as though it were written by a person. Using a survey and semi-structured interviews, this exploratory mixed-method study examined social work educators' experiences of addressing students' use of ChatGPT and found that although they are uncomfortable with addressing ChatGPT use with their students, they believe it is necessary to communicate its ethical use to them. Results also suggested that while using ChatGPT as a learning tool is valid, it can be overused. ChatGPT use gives students a fals

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT has left people feeling ambivalent and disagreement among scholars, academicians, educators and the community at large prevails. While the artificial intelligence could potentially revolutionize how research is conducted and how research papers are written, a number of ethical concerns arise. In particular, the world of academia has reservations pertaining to whether this language model will actually do more good than harm, especially as far as academic writing is concerned. This paper argues that the cutting-edge technology is here to stay and the question is not whether to accept it, but rather, how to best utilize it judiciously, cautiously and responsibly to improve research performance by strictly adhering to academic integrity and transparency. Potential benefits and drawbacks of ChatGPT will be critically examined in light of current literature and, when relevant, potential solutions to the drawbacks will also

AB  - This study investigates student responses to allegations of cheating using ChatGPT, a popular software platform capable of generating coherent text on various topics. Data comprising 49 Reddit posts and discussions between December 2022 and June 2023 were collected. Students shared their experiences, often asserting false accusations, and discussed strategies to navigate these situations. Thematic analysis identified five key themes: adopting a legalistic stance with argumentation and evidence; higher education's role as a societal gatekeeper; vicissitudes of trust in students vs. technology; questions of what constitutes cheating; and the need to rethink assessment. These findings will aid educators and institutions in crafting more meaningful assessments in the age of AI and establishing guidelines for student usage of ChatGPT and similar tools.

However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In online learning, learner-instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety of these interactions.

Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades. Students who failed the course also had significantly fewer messages endorsed by all three ML algorithms than those who passed.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to predict students' performance in an introductory physics class. The prediction model classified students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a grade of C, D, F or withdraw from the class. Early prediction could better allow the direction of educational interventions and the allocation of educational resources. However, the performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B, or C (the ABC outcome) or if they would receive a D, F or withdraw (W) from the class (the DFW outcome) because the outcome is substantially unbalanced with between 10% to 20% of the students receiving a D, F, or W.

Therefore, Content Based Video retrieval has become the challenging research area under pattern recognition and computer vision in higher education through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Text plays a dynamic role in understanding the true meaning of behavior of the video. Hence, it is challenging to detect and identify the text in video due to variable complex background, low contrast, blur, poor illumination, font size, font-style, occlusions.

AB  - This study implemented a blended learning mode with the aid of artificial intelligence teaching platform in the English language course. In this study, 110 students majoring in computer network were randomly selected as subjects, 55 of whom was the experimental group, the rest of 55 was the control group. Before the experiment, this study carried out a pretest on the two groups to determine whether there were differences between them in English learning, and verified the feasibility of the experiment. Meanwhile, a questionnaire was conducted on the learning attitude, style and evaluation of them. Then, traditional classroom teaching was adopted in the control group, and the blended learning mode based on the intelligent cloud teaching platform was used in the experimental group. After a semester of experimental research, through comparative analytics of questionnaire, experimental data and platform data with SPSS 21.0, it was found that this mode was helpful to stimulate the endogenou

TI  - Bias in Automatic Speech Recognition: The Case of African American Language
AU  - Martin, Joshua L.

T2  - Applied Linguistics
AB  - Research on bias in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in recent years, especially around racial bias. Many modern technologies which impact people's lives have been shown to have significant racial biases, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Emerging studies have found that widely-used ASR systems function much more poorly on the speech of Black people. Yet, this work is limited because it lacks a deeper consideration of the sociolinguistic literature on African American Language (AAL). In this paper, then, we seek to integrate AAL research into these endeavors to analyze ways in which ASRs might be biased against the linguistic features of AAL and how the use of biased ASRs could prove harmful to speakers of AAL. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the ways in which AAL has been discriminated against in the workforce and healthcare in the past, and (2) explore how introducing biased ASRs in these areas could perpetuate or even deepen linguistic

Increased adoption of this technology can be attributed to its ability of processing enormous amounts of data promptly in addressing specific queries and producing customized intelligent recommendations. While CC's transformative technologies offer profound benefits to the healthcare industry, it also carries an unpredictable burden of risk and mistakes with damaging consequences to patients. At this juncture, CC's legal place in healthcare is largely undefined as the applicable liability framework is ambiguous.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the effects of a custom-developed, artificial intelligence-based, asynchronous remote invigilation system on the student user experience. The study was conducted over 3 years at a large Australian university, and findings demonstrate that familiarity with the system over time improved student attitudes towards remote invigilation. Positive experiences were found to be related to ease of use and convenience for test sitting. The majority of students reported that it was important for the institution to have approaches such as remote invigilation to discourage cheating and they believed that the system was useful in this regard. Perceived technical problems were found to invoke feelings of anxiety with being remotely invigilated, and students suggested that greater clarity on expectations of appropriate behaviour, privacy and data security would help alleviate discomfort and improve the system.

T2  - Educational Technology &amp; Society
AB  - In traditional instruction, teachers generally deliver the content of textbooks to students via lectures, making teaching activities lack vibrancy. Moreover, in such a one-to-many teaching mode, the teacher is usually unable to check on individual students' learning status or to provide immediate feedback to resolve their learning problems. Chatbots provide an opportunity to address this problem. However, conventional chatbots generally serve as information providers (i.e., providing relevant information by matching keywords in a conversation) rather than as decision-making advisors (i.e., using a knowledge-base with a decision-making mechanism to help users solve problems). Thus, this study proposes an expert decision-making-based chatbot to facilitate individual students' construction of knowledge during the learning process. A quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the differences in the performances and perceptions of students using the expert decision-making-based chatbot (EDM

To address this research gap, this study delved into the acceptance of an intent-based chatbot specifically designed to aid preservice teachers (n = 92) during planning tasks. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), findings indicate that Perceived Usefulness was a significant predictor of Chatbot Use, while the role of Ease of Use was more nuanced. Qualitative data analysis provided valuable insights into the factors that influence chatbot adoption or nonadoption, allowing for a contextualized understanding within the TAM framework.

Nevertheless, little research has been done to examine discipline faculty's perspectives on mis/disinformation or the extent to which they are addressing the issue in their classrooms. This paper begins to address this gap in the literature through a nationwide study and follow-up interviews of faculty across disciplines to probe their perspectives on the challenges of mis/disinformation. Participants were asked about their views on mis/disinformation, whether and how they address mis/disinformation in their courses, and their perceptions of their students' ability to identify and evaluate mis/disinformation.

However, state-of-the-art Automatic Article Generator (AAG) writing powered by Artificial Intelligence provides a new platform for new types of serious academic misconduct that cannot be easily detected and even if they are detected, can be hard to prove. The main objective of this study is to raise awareness of these tools among academics. This paper first explains the features of AAG writing, then investigates whether academics can distinguish AAG writing from human writing and whether raising the awareness of AAG between academics can improve their ability to detect AAG writing. A case study showed how difficult it is for academics with no knowledge of AAGs to identify this writing. A surv

AB  - Student evaluation surveys provide educational institutions with important feedback regarding the student experience of teaching and courses; however, qualitative comments can contain offensive, insulting or threatening content. Large educational institutions generate thousands of comments per academic term; therefore, manual screening processes to find potentially harmful comments are not generally feasible. We developed a methodology for semi-automated screening of student comments that incorporates a machine learning decision support system and a detailed psychological assessment protocol. In a case study at a large public Australian university, our system identified 4,258 out of 62,049 (6.9%) comments as potentially harmful and requiring further review. Feedback from stakeholders demonstrates that this methodology is useful in reducing staff workload and could be broadly applied to different settings.

AB  - Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks, performance predictions based on student scores are generally made, but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study, performances of 3518 university students, who studying and actively participating in a learning management system, were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender, content score, time spent on the content, number of entries to content, homework score, number of attendance to live sessions, total time spent in live sessions, number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables.

AB  - With the deep application of artificial intelligence and big data in education, adaptive learning has become a new research hotspot in online education. Based on the systematic review of the connotation and research progress of adaptive learning, a new definition of adaptive learning is given. By literature analysis, this paper points out the challenges faced by adaptive learning research, such as the lack of cognition of brain and technology, the bottleneck of the model of emotion domain, the separation of education and technology, the security of data management and the risk of privacy leakage. These challenges can be summarized into two aspects: one is mechanical issues, the other is safety issues. Different from traditional research perspectives, the paper opens a new research window, and puts forward countermeasures from the perspectives of cognitive principles, zone of proximal development theory in technology, breakthrough in the emotional domain model, learning data management

AB  - Use of university students' educational data for learning analytics has spurred a debate about whether and how to provide students with agency regarding data collection and use. A concern is that students opting out of learning analytics may skew predictive models, in particular if certain student populations disproportionately opt out and biases are unintentionally introduced into predictive models. We investigated university students' propensity to consent to learning analytics through an email prompt, and collected respondents' perceived benefits and privacy concerns regarding learning analytics in a subsequent online survey. In particular, we studied whether and why students' consent propensity differs among student subpopulations by sending our email prompt to a sample of 4,000 students at our institution stratified by ethnicity and gender. 272 students interacted with the email, of which 119 also completed the survey. We identified that institutional trust, concerns with the amo

AB  - Data collection and analysis is nothing new in computer-assisted language learning, but with the phenomenon of massive sets of human language collected into corpora, and especially integrated into systems driven by artificial intelligence, new opportunities have arisen for language teaching and learning. We are now seeing powerful artificial neural networks with impressive language capabilities. In education, data provides means to track learner performance and improve learning, especially through the application of data mining to expose hidden patterns of learner behavior. Massive data collection also raises issues of transparency and fairness. Human monitoring is essential in applying data analysis equitably. Big data may have as powerful an impact in language learning as it is having in society generally; it is an important resource to have available, but one to use with care and caution.

AB  - Spatial computing is the fourth paradigm of the digital revolution and could profoundly transform learning. It is the convergence of several technological developments, including Augmented and Virtual Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence, haptic feedback, motion-capture, and situational awareness engines. This article explores how the shift from 2D screens to virtual worlds will impact learning and raise new ethical and digital literacy challenges. Spatial computing goes far beyond the simple use of a VR headset for virtual experiences. Microsoft's experimental Dreamwalker project has already demonstrated how a user can remain entirely immersed in a virtual environment while successfully navigating the real world around them. These developments offer far-reaching implications for learning and our social interactions. Students may prefer virtual embodied avatars who are adaptive, personalized, and available anytime over real faculty - or they may gain a new-found appreciation for huma

AB  - Background/Context: School transitions pose a variety of social-emotional and academic challenges to students, especially those who are more vulnerable due to home, health, or academic challenges (Eccles et al., 1997; Felmlee, 2018). With this awareness, a growing number of school districts have developed and implemented early warning indicator systems (EWISs) aimed at early identification of and support to vulnerable students (e.g., Allensworth &amp; Easton, 2005; Balfanz &amp; Neild, 2006). Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: While a growing body of research has documented EWISs use objective criteria to identify vulnerable students, there is scant scholarship about student identification using subjective tools, the processes that facilitate information sharing and collaboration between sending and receiving schools, and effective student supports. Our study aimed to narrow the gaps in the literature by providing insight about EWI identification, between-school commu

This study aimed to provide personalized intervention for each group participating in computer-supported collaborative learning. The personalized intervention adopted a deep neural network model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to automatically classify online discussion transcripts and provide classification results in real time. Personalized feedback and recommendations were automatically generated from the classification results. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted to examine the effects of the proposed personalized intervention approach on collaborative knowledge building, group performance, socially shared metacognitive regulation, and cognitive load. Sixty-six college students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. For online collaborative learning, students in the e

The current study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of automated personalized feedback intervention implemented via the Student Advice Recommender Agent (SARA) in a first-year biology class by means of statistical matching and by reviewing and comparing four different statistical matching methods (i.e., exact matching, nearest neighbor matching using the Mahalanobis distance, propensity score matching, and coarsened exact matching). Data from 1026 (73% female and 27% male) students who took a first-year biology course at a Western Canadian university were used. Two different measures for balance assessment of the matched data (i.e., % of balance improvement and standardized bias) were used to choose the best performing statistical matching method. Nearest neighbor matching using the Mahalanobis distance was found

T2  - Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education
AB  - Contract cheating happens when students outsource their assessed work to a third party. One approach that has been suggested for improving contract cheating detection is comparing students' assignment submissions with their previous work, the rationale being that changes in style may indicate a piece of work has been written by somebody else. This approach is time consuming, but recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing suggest that it may be well suited to computerization. We trialed an early alpha version of Turnitin's Authorship Investigate tool, which compares students' submissions against their previous work. Twenty-four experienced markers from five units of study were asked to make decisions about the presence of contract cheating in bundles of 20 student assignments, which included 14 legitimate assignments and six purchased from contract cheating sites. We asked markers to determine if each assignment was contract cheating, then provided them with an
