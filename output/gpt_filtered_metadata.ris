T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into education, specifically through generative chatbots, can transform teaching and learning for education professionals in both administrative and pedagogical ways. However, the ethical implications of using generative chatbots in education must be carefully considered. Ethical concerns about advanced chatbots have yet to be explored in the education sector. This short article introduces the ethical concerns associated with introducing platforms such as ChatGPT in education. The article outlines how handling sensitive student data by chatbots presents significant privacy challenges, thus requiring adherence to data protection regulations, which may not always be possible. It highlights the risk of algorithmic bias in chatbots, which could perpetuate societal biases, which can be problematic. The article also examines the balance between fostering student autonomy in learning and the potential impact on academic self-efficacy, noting the risk of over-reliance on AI for educational purposes. Plagiarism continues to emerge as a critical ethical concern, with AI-generated content threatening academic integrity. The article advocates for comprehensive measures to address these ethical issues, including clear policies, advanced plagiarism detection techniques, and innovative assessment methods. By addressing these ethical challenges, the article argues that educators, AI developers, policymakers, and students can fully harness the potential of chatbots in education, creating a more inclusive, empowering, and ethically sound educational future.

T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - This survey study aims to understand how college students use and perceive artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It reports students' use, perceived motivations, and ethical concerns and how these variables are interrelated. Responses (n = 822) were collected from seven universities in five UAE emirates. The findings show widespread use of AI tools (79.6%), with various factors affecting students' perceptions about AI tools. Students also raised concerns about the lack of guidance on using AI tools. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed the underlining psychological mechanisms pertaining to AI tool adoption: perceived benefits fully mediated the relationship between AI knowledge and usefulness perceptions, peer pressure mediated the relationship between academic stress and AI adoption intent, and ethical concerns fully mediated the relationship between ethical perceptions and support for institutional AI regulations. The findings of this study provide implications for the opportunities and challenges posed by AI tools in higher education. This study is one of the first to provide empirical insights into UAE college students' use of AI tools, examining mediation models to explore the complexity of their motivations, ethical concerns, and institutional guidance. Ultimately, this study offers empirical data to higher education institutions and policymakers on student perspectives of AI tools in the UAE.

TI  - The role of perceived utility and ethical concerns in the adoption of AI-based data analysis tools: A multi-group structural equation model analysis among academic researchers
AU  - Zhang, XT
AU  - Hu, JW

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study explores the role of perceived utility, social influence, and ethical concerns in the adoption of AI-based data analysis tools among academic researchers in China, focusing on differences between public and private universities. The research aims to identify key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of AI technology in academic settings. A quantitative approach was employed, using a multi-group structural equation model (SEM) analysis to assess data collected from 750 academic researchers across various disciplines (N-pvt = 402; N-pub = 348). The findings reveal that both perceived utility and social influence significantly influence the adoption of AI tools. Higher perceived utility and stronger social influence lead to greater adoption. However, ethical concerns were found to moderate these relationships, particularly in public universities, where researchers with high ethical concerns perceived greater risks, thereby reducing their likelihood of adoption. In contrast, private university researchers showed a higher tolerance for perceived risks when utility and social influence were evident. The study's implications suggest that to promote AI adoption, institutions must address ethical concerns and perceived risks, particularly in public universities, by enhancing transparency, providing ethical guidelines, and offering comprehensive training. These efforts can lead to more effective integration of AI technologies, ultimately enhancing research productivity and innovation across diverse academic environments.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. This revolutionary technology holds immense potential in multiple domains, including the development of educational curricula. This article has explored the impact of AI on curriculum development in global higher education institutions, analyzing data from 2,000 faculty and student respondents, across five continents: North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, using a logistic regression model. The study found that frequent use of AI, the extent of the faculty knowledge, institution support to faculty, and the future expectation about AI are promoting curriculum development. Furthermore, the effectiveness of AI-driven tools in personalizing learning experiences, enhancing student engagement, identifying and addressing individual needs, providing real-time feedback, improving the quality of teaching and learning materials, and promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills is driving curriculum development. Moreover, the challenges limiting AI integration in curriculum development include its ability to personalize learning, adapt content based on student needs, ethical concerns, and hesitations in recommending AI use to other educational institutions. Besides, with respect to cultural and educational contexts in AI-powered tools, the integration of AI in global higher education curriculum development is hindered by its inability to align with and navigate the complexities of these contexts. In addition, educators' and leaders' perceptions and attitudes also influence AI's role in curriculum development. Factors such as AI's ability to create personalized learning experiences, familiarity with current AI tools, its effectiveness in identifying student learning gaps, willingness to undergo training and professional development, and its capacity to address biases in curriculum content stimulate development yet also present limitations. Importantly, our findings indicate that, while AI has enormous potential to revolutionize curriculum development, strategic approaches and policies are required to overcome the identified issues and improve AI integration in varied educational settings.

TI  - Academic communication with AI-powered language tools in higher education: From a post-humanist perspective
AU  - Ou, AW

T2  - SYSTEM
AB  - AI -powered language tools (AILTs) are commonly used by university students, yet there is a limited understanding of how students utilise and perceive these tools in everyday academic communication practice. Employing a post -humanist lens and based on over 1700 open-ended comments from a nationwide student survey, this qualitative study examined students' lived AILT experiences to explicate the impact of AILTs on academic communication in higher education learning and assessment. Thematic analysis of the data shows that students' academic writing is realised by assemblages of distributed spatial and personal linguistic repertoires, underscoring AILT's role in enhancing students' communicative performance and personal language development. AILTs are also conducive to transforming the academic writing process into an additional learning space. Students have developed a new identity as spatially advised learners, enabling them to assert their agency in terms of language development and subjectcontent knowledge while also holding critical perspectives on the limitations of AI. Furthermore, the findings point to divergent and eclectic student viewpoints on the ethical concerns of AILTs in assessment in the absence of university instructions. The study discusses implications for university policymaking and pedagogy in developing teaching and assessment methods that match students' stances and needs in AI -mediated academic communication.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online assessment, prompting debates over validity, security, and increasingly the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, especially generative AI, on traditional examination methods. This paper explores perceptions of the evolving landscape of online assessment and the role of AI within higher education, building on work conducted at the University of London and the Open University UK. Workshops used speculative methods to envision potential future scenarios and gather perspectives. These revealed a complex, ambivalent outlook on online assessment and AI's role in education. The paper highlights the polarised views surrounding AI, ranging from ethical concerns about academic integrity and unfair advantages to opportunities for enhancing learning and inclusivity in assessment practices. Our findings reflect attitudes of students and educators towards AI and online assessment, identifying key themes such as ethics and integrity, the need for redesigning assessments, issues of diversity and inclusion, and the dependencies required for successful integration of AI. Participants highlighted both the potential benefits of AI in creating more authentic and personalised assessment experiences and the risks of exacerbating inequalities and undermining institutional credibility. The paper underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach to AI and online assessment in educational policy and practice, emphasising inclusive, ethical, and innovative approaches to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these technological disruptors.

TI  - ChatGPT in Education - Understanding the Bahraini Academics Perspective
AU  - Alrayes, A
AU  - Henari, TF
AU  - Ahmed, DA
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - This paper provides a thorough examination of the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT and other AI language models, in the realm of education. Drawing insights from existing literature and a novel study on educator perspectives, the paper delves into the potential advantages, ethical dilemmas, and factors shaping educators' attitudes towards AI integration in education. AI language models have the potential to revolutionize educational content creation, personalize learning experiences, and streamline assessment and feedback processes. These capabilities hold the potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes while catering to the diverse needs of students. However, ethical concerns loom large in the adoption of AI in education. Bias in generated content is a chief concern, as it can perpetuate societal biases and lead to unfair treatment or the dissemination of inaccurate information. The solution lies in rigorous data curation to ensure equitable educational experiences for all students. Moreover, the potential for generating inappropriate or misleading content poses a significant ethical challenge, impacting students' well-being, civic understanding, and social interactions. Safeguards must be implemented to detect and rectify biased or inappropriate content, fostering inclusive and unbiased learning environments. Transparency emerges as a crucial ethical consideration. The opacity of AI models like ChatGPT makes it difficult to comprehend their decision-making processes. Enhancing model interpretability and explainability is vital for accountability and addressing embedded ethical issues. Privacy concerns related to data collection and usage are emphasized in the literature. Clear policies and guidelines must govern data collection, use, and protection, ensuring data is solely employed for educational purposes and maintaining robust data security measures.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools hold significant promises for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. However, continues usage behavior and satisfaction of educators with GenAI systems are still less explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors influencing academic staff satisfaction and continuous GenAI usage in higher education, employing a survey method and analyzing data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This research utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) as its theoretical foundations, while also integrating ethical concerns as a significant factor. Data was collected from a sample of 127 university academic staff through an online survey questionnaire. The study found a positive correlation between effort expectancy, ethical consideration, expectation confirmation, and academic staff satisfaction. However, performance expectancy did not show a positive correlation with satisfaction. Performance expectancy was positively related to the intention to use GenAI tools, while academic staff satisfaction positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The social influence did not correlate positively with the use of GenAI. Security and privacy were positively associated with staff satisfaction. Facilitation conditions also positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for academia and policymakers, guiding the responsible integration of GenAI tools in education while emphasizing factors for policy considerations and developers of GenAI tools.

AB  - The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, has transformed educational landscapes globally. Moreover, the Beijing Consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education and the 'Pact for the Future' propose that AI can support UNESCO in achieving development goals, especially focusing on SDG 4, which emphasizes quality education. Thus, this study investigates undergraduate students' familiarity with and attitudes toward AI tools, as well as their perceived risks and benefits of using AI tools at a private university in China. An explanatory sequential mixed-method design was employed with an online survey of 167 students, followed by a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses. Data were analyzed using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test and thematic analysis, supported by SPSS and ATLAS.ti 25. The findings revealed that students demonstrated moderate familiarity with AI tools, particularly ChatGPT and willingness to use them in coursework. Positive attitudes toward AI's value in education were evident, although concerns such as dependence and reduced independent thinking, algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, accuracy and information quality, data security, and privacy concerns were observed among students. Moreover, students generally viewed AI positively and perceived AI integration as inevitable and becoming common in academic settings. Students were concerned that the misuse of AI by their teachers was minimal and trusted their teachers to use AI effectively in teaching. Students also perceived AI's benefits, such as personalized learning, efficiency and convenience, career and skill development, and support for independent learning. This study contributes to the discourse on AI integration in higher education by highlighting students' nuanced perceptions and balancing their benefits with potential risks. The findings of this study were limited by the small sample size and institution. Future research should explore diverse contexts to develop comprehensive AI implementation frameworks for higher education.

AB  - This study examines the potentials and challenges of integrating conversational AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools in higher education. Specifically, the study delves into how ChatGPT is reshaping teaching, learning, research, and student evaluation while addressing ethical concerns such as academic integrity. We employ a qualitative research design based on semi-structured interviews with 12 highly accomplished academicians from North America, Asia, and Europe's higher education institutions. Our analysis reveals ChatGPT's potential to uplift educational productivity, learning outcomes, creativity, and idea generation but raises apprehensions about academic honesty, authenticity, and over-reliance. While ChatGPT can enhance educational practices such as brainstorming, analysis, and skills acquisition, its unchecked use may impede learning, critical thinking, and research quality. The study advocates for the responsible AI use in academia, underscoring educators and policymakers to establish policies guiding conversational AI ethical applications. Thus, training faculty and executing institutional policies are essential for effective and ethical integration of ChatGPT and other AI tools in higher education. Finally, this research contributes to ongoing research on AI in education by providing valuable insights that can harness potential of these transformative tools while upholding academic integrity and standards.

T2  - JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE
AB  - Higher education is currently under a significant transformation due to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, the hype surrounding GenAI and the increasing influence of educational technology business groups over tertiary education. This commentary, prepared for the Special Issue of the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice (JUTLP) on "Enhancing student engagement using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chatbots," delves into the complex landscape of opportunities and threats that AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, introduce to the realm of higher education. We argue that while GenAI offers promise in enhancing pedagogy, research, administration, and student support, concerns around academic integrity, labour displacement, embedded biases, environmental sustainability, increased commercialisation, and regulatory gaps necessitate a critical approach. Our commentary advocates for the development of critical AI literacy among educators and students, emphasising the necessity to foster an environment of responsible innovation and informed use of AI. We posit that the successful integration of AI in higher education must be grounded in the principles of ethics, equity, and the prioritisation of educational aims and human values. By offering a critical and nuanced exploration of these issues, our commentary aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how higher education institutions can navigate the rise of GenAI, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all stakeholders while upholding core academic values.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most prevalent topics in modern science. It is also reflected in the higher education sphere. Implementation of AI in university activities requires prior analysis of spheres where artificial intelligence can be used to provide responsible and smart use of AI. Based on the survey of educational process participants, the authors analysed the level of readiness of respondents to AI utilisation, their apprehension of AI's role in different spheres of university activities. The results of the survey have shown that most educational process participants either do not use artificial intelligence or use a very limited number of resources. Still the respondents estimated the possible impact of AI on different spheres of university activities as moderate or high. The spheres of open university ecosystem where AI can be used, were singled out and presented as a structural model. Among the spheres of university activities where AI can be implemented there are infrastructure, security, management and administration, research, ratings, sustainable development, learning personalisation, and e-learning. The selection of artificial intelligence tools for each sphere was performed and presented. Challenges of AI implementation are discussed, among which there are data security, privacy, ethical and legal issues, bias of AI, requirements to technical knowledge of university staff and university infrastructure, teachers' resistance, depersonalization of education, risks of education quality decrease. The advantages of AI implementation in each of the defined spheres are described. The need to document the rules of AI utilization at HEIs is stressed. The results of the research can be used for planning AI implementation in higher education institutions and AI policy formation.

AU  - Parapadakis, D
T2  - LONDON REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB  - The successes of using artificial intelligence (AI) in analysing large-scale data at a low cost make it an attractive tool for analysing student data to discover models that can inform decision makers in education. This article looks at the case of decision making from models of student satisfaction, using research on ten years (2008-17) of National Student Survey (NSS) results in UK higher education institutions. It reviews the issues involved in measuring student satisfaction, shows that useful patterns exist in the data and presents issues involved in the value within the data when they are examined without deeper understanding, contrasting the outputs of analysing the data manually, and with AI. The article discusses risks of using AI and shows why, when applied in areas of education that are not clear, understood and widely agreed, AI not only carries risks to a point that can eliminate cost savings but, irrespective of legal requirement, it cannot provide algorithmic accountability.

TI  - Student perceptions of ChatGPT: benefits, costs, and attitudinal differences between users and non-users toward AI integration in higher education
AU  - Blahopoulou, J
AU  - Ortiz-Bonnin, S
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Today, there is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both opportunities and challenges in higher education. This study examines three key areas: (1) students' use of ChatGPT, (2) their perceptions of its benefits and costs, and (3) the differences in attitudes toward AI integration in higher education between ChatGPT users and non-users. A sample of 737 undergraduate students at a Spanish university answered an online survey. The quantitative analysis revealed a high prevalence of ChatGPT use for academic and personal purposes, with students identifying its 24/7 accessibility as a major advantage, along with the time-saving benefits it offers. However, concerns were raised about potential costs, including the devaluation of university education when students rely on ChatGPT to complete assignments. Results indicate significant differences between ChatGPT users and non-users: users generally support AI integration in higher education, particularly in teaching methods, while non-users often oppose its integration, advocating for measures such as banning AI in universities. Our study provides valuable insights into student perspectives on the integration of ChatGPT in higher education, emphasizing the contrasting viewpoints of users and non-users. The findings underline the need for universities to actively involve students in shaping policies on artificial intelligence while offering targeted training to promote its responsible and ethical use. Furthermore, universities should support educators in adapting their teaching methodologies to the digital era by incorporating innovative strategies that enhance both teaching and learning.

T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The rapid integration of artificial intelligence in academic environments has created unprecedented challenges for maintaining academic integrity, particularly concerning AI-facilitated plagiarism (AIgiarism). Using stratified random sampling, we surveyed 373 undergraduate students across government universities in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate the complex interplay between institutional support mechanisms, moral-psychological processes, and students' engagement with AI tools in academic work. Through validated instruments, our research reveals a moderated mediation model where attitudes towards AI technology significantly mediate the relationship between academic support and AIgiarism (beta = -0.384, p < .001), with moral disengagement moderating both paths (beta = 0.152, p < .002; beta = 0.178, p < .001). These findings challenge traditional deterrence-based approaches to academic integrity and introduce the 'Mediated Digital Integrity Model,' emphasizing the dynamic interplay between institutional, attitudinal, and moral factors. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on digital academic integrity and provides crucial insights for developing integrated AI ethics programs in higher education.

AB  - Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has permeated various aspects of daily life, including education, specifically within higher education settings. These AI technologies have transformed pedagogy and learning, enabling a more personalized approach. However, ethical and practical concerns have also emerged, including the potential decline in cognitive skills and student motivation due to excessive reliance on AI.Objective To develop and validate a Scale for Dependence on Artificial Intelligence (DIA).Methods An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to identify the underlying structure of the DIA scale, followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess and confirm this structure. In addition, the scale's invariance based on participants' gender was evaluated.Results A total of 528 university students aged between 18 and 37 years (M = 20.31, SD = 3.8) participated. The EFA revealed a unifactorial structure for the scale, which was subsequently confirmed by the CFA. Invariance analyses showed that the scale is applicable and consistent for both men and women.Conclusion The DAI scale emerges as a robust and reliable tool for measuring university students' dependence on AI. Its gender invariance makes it applicable in diverse population studies. In the age of digitalization, it is essential to understand the dynamics between humans and AI to navigate wisely and ensure a beneficial coexistence.

AU  - Benuyenah, V
AU  - Dewnarain, S
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This initial qualitative study used in-depth interview data from students to examine their perceptions of ChatGPT and intentions regarding using artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. The students were sampled across business programmes at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels at an International University in the UAE. As of mid-2023, understanding student attitudes becomes crucial as AI increasingly becomes integrated into educational settings, therefore necessitating initial research. Additionally, the ethical dimension of ChatGPT use in assessment and future impact on careers was explored, considering concerns related to privacy, data security, bias, and transparency. Whilst all participants reported that they were familiar with the chatbot, a proportion of them indicated that the tool could help them improve their assignments, particularly in improving grammar. Some participants expressed concerns about the algorithm behind ChatGPT as well as the potential displacement of the labour force.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - An open access article under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more widely used in higher education, we must pay attention to the risks that can emerge. AI projects, whether applied in classroom learning or used for decision-making regarding admissions, financial aid allocation, or hiring, must include attention to governance and compliance issues, regardless of the project's scope and scale. Concerns highlighted in this work include transparency, user privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability, however, we note that this is a non-exhaustive list of risks. In this paper, risk assessment is defined, and two examples of risk management frameworks, namely the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework and the non-profit humanitarian effort ForHumanity's Independent Audit of AI, Algorithmic, and Autonomous Systems are briefly described. We identify characteristics of AI applications that need to be assessed for vulnerabilities they may present, such as bias and discrimination. This paper aims to facilitate discussion among stakeholders about the risks that may be encountered from using AI in higher education, as well as to suggest ways developers, decision-makers, and users can mitigate these risks. Much discussion and published literature has focused on risk management frameworks designed for large organizations or enterprises or frameworks that do not consider risks specific to AI. We hope that decision-makers carefully consider the risks, perform due diligence when implementing AI applications, and create a plan for mitigating the risks. This research supports e-learning practice because students and faculty are embracing AI applications. Leaders and decision-makers in higher education need to be proactive in protecting their varied stakeholders. The paper asks what risks may be encountered by institutions of higher education when using AI tools and products in the classroom and for various aspects of decision-making and if published frameworks can mitigate these risks.

A2  - Roumate, F
AB  - AI offers new opportunities to facilitate sustainable development and the inclusion of all actors within this process, which starts with education and science that were massively influenced by AI during the pandemic COVID-19 because of the transition of all countries to the hybrid system of higher education. This paper deals with the ethics of AI and scientific research. Three points are discussed in this paper. First, AI opportunities and challenges related to higher education and scientific research. The second is the importance of the ethics of AI in higher education and scientific research, and the third point is the new strategies and policy actions needed to ensure social development. As is concluded in this paper, optimal actions are needed, especially new international and national mechanisms, rethinking public policies, and reinforcement of the investment in this field becomes thus an obligation rather than a choice.

TI  - Shifting Dynamics: Who Holds the Reins in Decision-Making With Artificial Intelligence Tools? Perspectives of Gen Z Pre-Service Teachers
AU  - Merzifonluoglu, A
AU  - Gunes, H
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly shaping education and currently influencing pre-service teachers' academic and professional journeys. To explore this influence, the present study examines 389 Generation Z pre-service teachers' attitudes towards AI and its impact on educational decision-making at two state universities, using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods research design. Quantitative data were collected through the General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) and an AI decision-making survey. It was followed by qualitative data gathered via semi-structured interviews to enrich the statistical trends with deeper thematic insights. SPSS was used for quantitative data analysis while MAXQDA was employed for a systematic analysis of the qualitative data. The analysis revealed that female pre-service teachers held more positive attitudes towards AI, with higher levels of AI knowledge contributing to these attitudes. Negative attitudes, however, were independent of gender, academic discipline or AI familiarity. Findings also reveal that AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, are primarily used as advisors, and pre-service teachers often adapt AI's suggestions to their preferences. AI is predominantly preferred for assignments, reports, projects and presentations. In AI acceptance, time and effort savings, innovative suggestions and unbiased recommendations are stated as key factors. However, there are ongoing trust concerns highlighting the necessity of keeping final decisions under human control. Based on these findings, comprehensive AI training for teachers and students in higher education is suggested.

TI  - AI, Biometric Analysis, and Emerging Cheating Detection Systems: The Engineering of Academic Integrity?
AU  - Oravec, JA
T2  - EDUCATION POLICY ANALYSIS ARCHIVES
AB  - Cheating behaviors have been construed as a continuing and somewhat vexing issue for academic institutions as they increasingly conduct educational processes online and impose metrics on instructional evaluation. Research, development, and implementation initiatives on cheating detection have gained new dimensions in the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) applications; they have also engendered special challenges in terms of their social, ethical, and cultural implications. An assortment of commercial cheating-detection systems have been injected into educational contexts with little input on the part of relevant stakeholders. This paper expands several specific cases of how systems for the detection of cheating have recently been implemented in higher education institutions in the US and UK. It investigates how such vehicles as wearable technologies, eye scanning, and keystroke capturing are being used to collect the data used for anti-cheating initiatives, often involving systems that have not gone through rigorous testing and evaluation for their validity and potential educational impacts. The paper discusses accountability- and policy-related issues concerning the outsourcing of cheating detection in institutional settings in the light of these emerging technological practices as well as student resistance against the systems involved. The cheating-detection practices can place students in a disempowered, asymmetrical position that is often at substantial variance with their cultural backgrounds.

T2  - JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
AB  - PurposeThis purpose of this paper is to report on the development of an evidence-informed framework created to facilitate the formulation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) academic integrity policy responses for English medium instruction (EMI) higher education, responding to both the bespoke challenges for the sector and longstanding calls to define and disseminate quality implementation good practice.Design/methodology/approachA virtual nominal group technique engaged experts (n = 14) in idea generation, refinement and consensus building across asynchronous and synchronous stages. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively.FindingsThe GenAI Academic Integrity Policy Development Blueprint for EMI Tertiary Education is not a definitive mandate but represents a roadmap of inquiry for reflective deliberation as institutions chart their own courses in this complex terrain.Research limitations/implicationsIf repeated with varying expert panellists, findings may vary to a certain extent; thus, further research with a wider range of stakeholders may be necessary for additional validation.Practical implicationsWhile grounded within the theoretical underpinnings of the field, the tool holds practical utility for stakeholders to develop bespoke policies and critically re-examine existing frameworks.Social implicationsAs texts produced by students using English as an additional language are at risk of being wrongly accused of GenAI-assisted plagiarism, owing to the limited efficacy of text classifiers such as Turnitin, the policy recommendations encapsulated in the blueprint aim to reduce potential bias and unfair treatment of students.Originality/valueThe novel blueprint represents a step towards bridging concerning gaps in policy responses worldwide and aims to spark discussion and further much-needed scholarly exploration to this end.

AB  - The increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in management curricula raises the need to integrate AI into assessment systems. For this purpose, this study used anxiety and resistance to change with an integrated variable, adoption readiness' to examine university teachers' attitudes towards AI-based assessment systems. We collected data from university teachers in social sciences and management disciplines from West Malaysia. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to determine the ability of the UTAUT model antecedent to the proposed method. After eliminating the distorting observed variable, this study used performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions as 'adoption readiness'. The results of path analysis indicated that (1) anxiety has a significant negative impact on adoption readiness and attitude of university teachers; (2) positive but insignificant impact of resistance to change on adoption readiness and attitude; (3) adoption readiness mediates the relationship between anxiety and attitude while; (4) no mediation role of adoption readiness was found between the relationship of resistance to change and attitude of the university teachers towards an AI-based assessment systems. This study significantly contributes to the existing pedagogical literature by synthesizing the UTAUT model's antecedents in a novel way to examine technology adoption readiness which further adds in the originality of this study.

T2  - INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This qualitative study explores the levels of technology acceptance of students and teachers in higher education regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in summative assessment. Twelve students and eight teachers of a university expressed their views on a series of hypothetical scenarios. Stimulated recall interviews, using hypothetical scenarios, were conducted with 12 of them, applying convenience sampling. Student and teacher views were aligned regarding technology's potential for efficiency and personalised feedback, while both groups underlined the need for explainability and trust, noting also that a teacher knows more about a student's learning trajectory than a submitted assignment could depict. Both groups also expressed concerns that reach beyond technology performance. For students, introducing AI for summative assessment could break the student-teacher connection, while for teachers such a step could take away opportunities for professional development, as grading is considered an essential skill for them.

T2  - INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The use of generative AI is controversial in education largely because of its potential impact on academic integrity. Yet some scholars have suggested it could be particularly beneficial for students with disabilities. To date there has been no empirical research to discover how these students use generative AI in academic writing. Informed by a prior interview study and AI-literacy model, we surveyed students regarding their use of generative AI, and gained 124 valid responses from students with disabilities. We identified primary conditions affecting writing such as ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autism. The main generative AI used were chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, and rewriting applications. They were used in a wide range of academic writing tasks. Key concerns students with disabilities had included the inaccuracy of AI answers, risks to academic integrity, and subscription cost barriers. Students expressed a strong desire to participate in AI policymaking and for universities to provide generative AI training. The paper concludes with recommendations to address educational disparities and foster inclusivity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT with their human-like intelligence and language processing capabilities are significantly impacting the way we live, work, and communicate with each other. While scholars have increasingly focused on the use of GenAI in higher education since its inception, little is known about how key higher education stakeholders, particularly students, perceive its impact on teaching and learning within the context of academic communication, an area central to students' development of transferable skills and literacy competencies yet heavily influenced by the technology. This empirical study addresses the gap by investigating students' experiences and attitudes toward GenAI tools for English academic communication, focusing on their overall perceptions, perceived benefits, limitations, and challenges. Drawing on data from a questionnaire survey with 475 students and interviews with 12 at two universities in China, our findings indicate that students generally view GenAI positively, considering them useful for learning academic communication skills, particularly in writing, grammar, vocabulary, and reading. However, limitations are recognized in terms of giving feedback on critical thinking, creativity, and speaking skills. In addition, information reliability, ethical issues, and impact on assessment and academic integrity also emerged as important concerns. Our study argues that universities should embrace and capitalize on the affordances of GenAI and address its challenges to better support students' learning of critical academic literacy.

AB  - The popularity of ChatGPT raises concerns about the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on higher education. While past research explored how ChatGPT, a widely recognized text-based generative AI, can improve productivity and efficiency in education, little is yet known about its impact on course design. Utilizing Bloom's taxonomy and Biggs' constructive alignment, this research examined the potential influence of ChatGPT on course design. We conducted 19 interviews with lecturers from seven universities located in different countries, who teach a range of business school courses with course objectives at various Bloom's levels. Additionally, we interviewed three educational specialists with expertise in educational technology and pedagogy. Respondents had mixed opinions about ChatGPT's influence on learning and course design. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of ChatGPT may be influenced by the complexity of learning outcomes as defined by Bloom's taxonomy. The researchers propose a framework that teachers can use to mitigate its negative impacts.

AB  - Generative AI has prompted educators to reevaluate traditional teaching and assessment methods. This study examines AI's ability to write essays analysing Old English poetry; human markers assessed and attempted to distinguish them from authentic analyses of poetry by first-year undergraduate students in English at the University of Oxford. Using the standard UK University grading system, AI-written essays averaged a score of 60.46, whilst human essays achieved 63.57, a margin of difference not statistically significant (p = 0.10). Notably, student submissions applied a nuanced understanding of cultural context and secondary criticism to their close reading, while AI essays often described rather than analysed, lacking depth in the evaluation of poetic features, and sometimes failing to properly recognise key aspects of passages. Distinguishing features of human essays included detailed and sustained analysis of poetic style, as well as spelling errors and lack of structural cohesion. AI essays, on the other hand, exhibited a more formal structure and tone but sometimes fell short in incisive critique of poetic form and effect. Human markers correctly identified the origin of essays 79.41% of the time. Additionally, we compare three purported AI detectors, finding that the best, 'Quillbot', correctly identified the origin of essays 95.59% of the time. However, given the high threshold for academic misconduct, conclusively determining origin remains challenging. The research also highlights the potential benefits of generative AI's ability to advise on structuring essays and suggesting avenues for research. We advocate for transparency regarding AI's capabilities and limitations, and this study underscores the importance of human critical engagement in teaching and learning in Higher Education. As AI's proficiency grows, educators must reevaluate what authentic assessment is, and consider implementing dynamic, holistic methods to ensure academic integrity.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational institutions is part of a global trend shaped by the capabilities of this technology. However, due to the disruptive nature of AI technologies, it greatly affects the way of teaching and learning. It is therefore essential to establish clear guidelines that not only ensure that all competencies required by the curricula are still effectively taught, but also empower students to use the new technology in a productive manner. Developing such guidelines for emerging and dynamic technologies is a very challenging task, as rules often struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving advancements. The European Union found a good way to tackle this problem in its AI Act by introducing a risk-based approach to regulate AI applications of organizations. Depending on the level of risk, applications might be prohibited, require extensive analysis and safeguards, have transparency obligations, or need no further action. This paper adapts the core structure of the AI Act regulation for the education sector to provide teachers and students with a structured framework for dealing with AI. Various use cases, based on teaching and learning life cycles, are presented to illustrate the versatility of AI in teaching and the learning process. By establishing such a framework, we not only promote competence development in dealing with AI but also contribute to the creation of an ethical and responsible use of AI in education.

AB  - This study investigates the acceptance and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) among in-service teachers in Lesotho, focusing on the mediating role of school support and resources (SSR). In Lesotho's educational landscape, which is characterized by a growing interest in technology integration, this study fills an essential gap in the existing literature by exploring in-service teachers' perspectives on AI adoption and the mediating influence of SSR. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical framework, the study adopts a cross-sectional design, collecting data from a sample of 315 in-service teachers through online surveys. The data was analyzed using maximum likelihood estimation. The results reveal a substantial positive relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and a positive attitude towards AI, with SSR playing a pivotal role as a complementary mediator in these connections. However, the study identifies a nonsignificant relationship between technical proficiency and behavioral intention, suggesting a need for further investigation into the technical skills essential for effective AI integration. The results highlight the critical role of SSR in shaping in-service teachers' intentions to use AI in their teaching practices. As a result, the study recommends tailored continuous professional development programs and collaborative learning communities to enhance teachers' skills. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of advocating for policies that support AI integration in education and underscores the ethical considerations related to AI use. We discuss the implications of our results concerning integrating AI into teachers' teaching practices in schools and outline future directions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING EDUCATION
AB  - Marketing instructors increasingly are using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency in course planning and assessment. However, scholarship has yet to show how such use impacts student evaluations, which are often skewed by gender bias. Toward this aim, we conducted a quasi-experiment in which college-student participants viewed student work along with instructor feedback under four experimental conditions. In one condition, participants were told the grade and feedback were written by the instructor and, in another, that the feedback was generated by an AI tool trained by the instructor. Instructor gender was also manipulated. Participants evaluated the assessment and the instructor using measures of agency and competence. We found that perceptions of agency and competence were higher for male instructors than for female instructors who did not use an AI tool. However, when instructors used AI, marked reductions in gender differences occurred. These findings suggest that AI complicates perceptions of agency and competence enough to potentially level the playing field for female instructors. However, perceptions of instructors were universally more negative when participants were told the assessment was created with AI, regardless of instructor gender. Therefore, attempts to use AI as an assessment tool should be made with caution.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Background The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), and especially generative AI, is transforming many medical fields, while medical education faces new challenges in integrating AI into the curriculum and is facing challenges with the rise of generative AI chatbots.Objective This survey study aimed to assess medical students' attitudes toward AI in medicine in general, effects of AI in students' career plans, and students' use of generative AI in medical studies.Methods An anonymous and voluntary online survey was designed using SurveyMonkey and was sent out to medical students at Gothenburg University. It consisted of 25 questions divided into various sections aiming to evaluate the students' prior knowledge of AI, their use of generative AI during medical studies, their attitude toward AI in medicine in general, and the effect of AI on their career plans.Results Of the 172 students who completed the survey, 74% were aware of AI in medicine, and 71% agreed or strongly agreed that AI will improve medicine. One-third were frightened of the increased use of AI in medicine. Radiologists and pathologists were perceived as most likely to be replaced by AI. Interestingly, 37% of the responders agreed or strongly agreed that they will exclude some field of medicine because of AI. More than half argued that AI should be part of medical training. Almost all responders (99%) were aware of generative AI chatbots, and 64% had taken advantage of these in their medical studies. Fifty-eight percent agreed or strongly agreed that the use of AI is supporting their learning as medical students.Conclusion Medical students show high expectations for AI's impact on medicine, yet they express concerns about their future careers. Over a third would avoid fields threatened by AI. These findings underscore the need to educate students, particularly in radiology and pathology, about optimizing human-AI collaboration rather than viewing it as a threat. There is an obvious need to integrate AI into the medical curriculum. Furthermore, the medical students rely on AI chatbots in their studies, which should be taken into consideration while restructuring medical education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundAs artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly advances, it becomes imperative to equip students with tools to navigate through the many intricate ethical considerations surrounding its development and use. Despite growing recognition of this necessity, the integration of AI ethics into higher education curricula remains limited. This paucity highlights an urgent need for comprehensive ethics education initiatives in AI, particularly for science and engineering students who are at the forefront of these innovations. Hence, this research investigates the role of an online explicit-reflective learning module in fostering science and engineering graduate students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and problem-solving skills. The study's participants included 90 graduate students specializing in diverse science and engineering research tracks. Employing the embedded mixed-methods approach, data were collected from pre- and post-intervention questionnaires with closed-ended and open-ended questions.ResultsThe study's results indicate that the online explicit-reflective learning module significantly enhanced students' knowledge of AI ethics. Initially, students exhibited a medium-high level of perceived ethical awareness, which saw a modest but statistically significant enhancement following the participation. Notably, a more distinct increase was observed in students' actual awareness of ethical issues in AI, before and after the intervention. Content analysis of students' responses to the open-ended questions revealed an increase in their ability to identify and articulate concerns relating to privacy breaches, the utilization of flawed datasets, and issues of biased social representation. Moreover, while students initially displayed limited problem-solving abilities in AI ethics, a considerable enhancement in these competencies was evident post-intervention.ConclusionsThe study results highlight the important role of explicit-reflective learning in preparing future professionals in science and engineering with the skills necessary for ethical decision-making. The study highlights the need for placing more emphasis not only on students' ability to identify AI-related ethical issues but also on their capacity to resolve and perhaps mitigate the impact of such ethical dilemmas.

AU  - Verano-Tacoronte, D
AU  - Bolívar-Cruz, A
AU  - Sosa-Cabrera, S
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study investigates the role of technology-related anxiety in shaping university teachers' behavioral intention to adopt ChatGPT. Three distinct types of anxiety are examined: (a) anxiety about the future of the academic profession, (b) anxiety regarding the personal misuse of ChatGPT, and (c) anxiety concerning negative impacts on student learning. A structured questionnaire was administered to 249 faculty members from Spanish public universities. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess both the direct effects of each type of anxiety on behavioral intention and the mediating roles of effort expectancy (EE) and performance expectancy (PE). Results indicate that anxiety about student learning exhibits a significant negative direct effect on behavioral intention and an indirect effect through performance expectancy. Similarly, anxiety related to the misuse of ChatGPT is negatively associated with behavioral intention, with significant mediation through both EE and PE. In contrast, anxiety concerning the future of the academic profession does not show a statistically significant relationship with behavioral intention. The findings underscore the importance of addressing specific psychological barriers-particularly those linked to concerns over student learning and technology misuse-to facilitate ChatGPT integration in higher education. The study suggests that effective implementation strategies should combine technical training with targeted interventions aimed at managing technology-related anxiety, enhancing ethical practices, and improving perceptions of the tool's utility and ease of use.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - ChatGPT, as an example of generative artificial intelligence, possesses high-level conversational and problem-solving capabilities supported by powerful computational models and big data. However, the powerful performance of ChatGPT might enhance learner dependency. Although it has not yet been confirmed, many teachers and scholars are also concerned about this issue. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate this topic further. This study's objective is to explore the association between inert thinking, positive experiences with ChatGPT, avoidance learning motivation, and ChatGPT dependence, based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model. Employing a cross-sectional design, we conducted an online survey with 870 Taiwanese university students, who had an average age of 22.81 years. The study found that inert thinking was positively associated with both positive experiences with ChatGPT and ChatGPT dependence. Furthermore, a significant association was found between inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation. Positive experience with ChatGPT was also positively related to avoidance learning motivation and ChatGPT dependence. Due to the scarcity of empirical research on generative artificial intelligence, the issues that people worry about when discussing AI were confirmed in this study. Moreover, avoidance learning motivation was positively correlated with ChatGPT dependence. Based on these findings, this study calls for educators to help students overcome inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation to prevent dependency on emerging technologies.

AB  - We are currently witnessing a global increase in the provision of software platforms and services, offered at << no cost >> by large corporations, to higher education. The business model behind these services is largely based on the collection and analysis of massive quantities of user data and metadata, collected through educational packages, which include e-mail, video-conferencing, groupware, file sharing, and other integrated services. The penetration of these services in higher education worldwide is largely unknown. In this study we discuss a methodology and a software script developed to collected new data for all 448 public higher education institutions in all 13 countries in South America. The data show that for every ten higher education institutions in the region, eight have services and platforms offered by such businesses. We contend that the adoption of these services is largely due to disinvestment in public education, and threaten the operational autonomy of institutions in regards to research and teaching, while leading to concerns in regards to data control, privacy, and transparency for teachers, administrators and students.

T2  - COGENT EDUCATION
AB  - ChatGPT, an AI chatbot created by OpenAI in November 2022, has caught the attention of scholars due to its potential in higher education. Despite its benefits in personalized learning, academic assistance, and task automation, concerns remain regarding its impact on students' logical reasoning and academic integrity. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study explored the predictors of behavioral intention to use the ChatGPT (BIU) for academic purposes among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Using a cross-sectional quantitative design, we gathered data via an online survey of 299 students from four universities in Mogadishu, Somalia. Structural equation modeling with SmartPLS 4 was used to analyze the proposed relationships. The results uncovered that perceived usefulness, ease of use, social influence, hedonic motivation, and credibility have positively and significantly impacted students' intention to use ChatGPT. Surprisingly, the findings depicted that perceived information accuracy negatively moderates the association between perceived ease of use and students' behavioral intention to use ChatGPT. The study's result implies that explicit guidelines should be established in Somali higher education to facilitate the proper utilization of ChatGPT, ensuring it improves learning while mitigating issues over information accuracy and academic integrity.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - Given the recent emergence of artificial intelligence as an important topic that can contribute to improve curricula and lecture delivery, an increasing number of scholars are investigating its impact in various educational fields. The ChatGPT, which is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement in the generative artificial intelligence area. Since its announcement, integrating the ChatGPT into computer programming curricula- and into other scientific curricula- has yielded some challenges. The main challenge is clearly evident in the conduct of in-class tests and in- lab assignments, where the students are given specific tasks to be accomplished within a certain time frame. As they might seek help from ChatGPT, these types of assessments could be considered a potential threat to academic integrity and may be viewed as a form of academic dishonesty. This study aims at integrating ChatGPT into computer programming curricula, exploring its potential to enhance undergraduate education. It follows a mixed methods approach to examine the potential integration of ChatGPT in teaching computer programming as a supplementary tool. A quasi-experimental design is followed, in which an experimental group is allowed to use ChatGPT and compared to a control group that was not. A research sample of 26 undergraduate students (13 males, 13 females) from the College of Education at Sultan Qaboos University participated in the study. The methodology encompassed three research instruments: in-class exams, in-lab assignments, and semi- structured interviews. These research instruments were utilized to assess the impact of ChatGPT on students' academic performance, which served as both independent (use of ChatGPT) and dependent (student performance) variables. The quantitative analysis revealed a significant enhancement in students' performance, while the qualitative analysis of semi- structured interviews indicated that participants view ChatGPT as a valuable support for learning. Feedback from participants suggested combining ChatGPT with traditional teaching methods to optimize learning outcomes. This study highlights the feasibility and educational benefits of incorporating AI tools like ChatGPT into teaching methodologies. It suggests that such integration can provide a more engaging and effective learning environment, potentially revolutionizing computer programming education. This paper supports e-learning practice by integrating AI-driven tools like ChatGPT into the educational framework and advances the e-learning area by demonstrating these technologies' potential to improve student academic performance in the learning environments. However, the study also acknowledges the need for further research to explore the long-term effects of AI integration in educational settings and to address any emerging challenges. These findings propose a promising direction for future curricular enhancements and suggest an effective method for the integration of AI technologies to support and enrich traditional educational frameworks.

AB  - Administrative burden in education is a serious issue for disabled students. Form-filling and bureaucracy are ubiquitous in further and higher education, particularly for students who need to disclose a disability and arrange for accommodations and support for an equitable educational experience. Paradoxically, many of these processes are inherently inaccessible for disabled students, and yet completing them can be critical to their success. Artificial Intelligence has potential to alleviate some of the burden imposed by administration and bureaucracy; virtual assistants and chatbots can replace forms with dialogue, without placing additional strain on institutions. However, it is essential that solutions are designed in partnership with disabled students to ensure that students' needs are met, their concerns addressed, and the final solution is equitable for them. This paper explores a case study of participatory research with disabled students in a large UK distance learning institution, in which participatory research identified an issue of administrative burden for disabled students, and a virtual assistant was designed as a solution using participatory design. It shares the methodology and design process, explores findings from different phases of the research, and shares recurrent themes arising throughout the study. In doing so, it aims to provide a foundation for future participatory research to reduce barriers for disabled students.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - This study technically analyses one of the online exam supervision technologies, namely the Artificial Intelligence-based Auto Proctoring (AiAP). This technology has been heavily presented to the academic sectors around the globe. Proctoring technologies are developed to provide oversight and analysis of students' behavior in online exams using AI, and sometimes with the supervision of human proctors to maintain academic integrity. Manual Testing methodology was used to do a software testing on AiAP for verification of any possible incorrect red flags or detections. The study took place in a Middle Eastern university by conducting online exams for 14 different courses, with a total of 244 students. The results were then verified by 5 human proctors in terms of monitoring measurements: screen violation, sound of speech, different faces, multiple faces, and eye movement detection. The proctoring decision was computed by averaging all monitoring measurements and then compared between the human proctors' and the AiAP decisions, to ultimately set the AiAP against a benchmark (human proctoring) and hence to be viable for use. The decision represented the number of violations to the exam conditions, and the result showed a significant difference between Human Decision (average 25.95%) and AiAP Decision (average 35.61%), and the total number of incorrect decisions made by AiAP was 74 out of 244 exam attempts, concluding that AiAP needed some improvements and updates to meet the human level. The researchers provided some technical limitations, privacy concerns, and recommendations to carefully review before deploying and governing such proctoring technologies at institutional level. This paper contributes to the field of educational technology by providing an evidence-based accuracy test on an automatic proctoring software, and the results demand institutional provision to better establish an appropriate online exam experience for higher educational institutions.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study aimed to investigate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools on postgraduate students' learning experiences. It examined how these students utilize GenAI tools, identified the perceived benefits of their use, and uncovered the challenges students face in their learning experiences with these tools. Background Recent advancements in GenAI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, are transforming how postgraduate students engage with learning, offering new opportunities for academic endeavors. However, understanding how students interact with these tools remains unclear, especially relating to their engagement with activities designed to use GenAI tools as learning assistants. Methodology This study employed a qualitative case study research design, including 11 female postgraduate students enrolled in an educational technology master's program as the primary data collection method. The researchers only had access to female students because of the gender-segregated education system at most Saudi universities. The participants were interviewed after they engaged in a planned activity called Designing a Training Program with GPT Assistance (DTPGA) and unplanned activities involving other GenAI tools. DTPGA is an activity aimed at integrating innovations in training technologies by designing a training program with ChatGPT assistance. Eleven ChatGPT conversation logs and DTPGA activity answers were analyzed based on specific rubrics. The results of the DTPGA activity analysis support the thematic analysis of the interviews. Contribution The key contributions of this study include the design and implementation of a planned activity (DTPGA) to understand how students interact with GenAI tools as learning assistants. Evaluating students' work on a DTPGA activity offers educators a clear vision for assessing GenAI-assisted tasks. In terms of data collection and analysis, this study also offers a deep understanding of the participants' perspectives and actual usage. The study identified two distinct usage patterns of GenAI among students, each classified with its characteristics and implications, shedding light on the diverse ways these tools are integrated into students' learning experiences. Furthermore, the findings provide compelling evidence of the risks associated with misunderstandings that can emerge when students misuse GenAI tools. Findings Students employ GenAI tools to have intellectual conversations, broaden their perspectives, and prototype and test their solutions. The research identified two distinct GenAI usage patterns - the intellectual partner and the information browser - each characterized by unique traits. The first pattern, intellectual partner, uses ChatGPT as a cognitive partner and interacts with it as if it were a real person. This usage tends to be dialogic, collaborative, selectively researching, persistent, and feedback-oriented. The second pattern, information browser, utilizes ChatGPT primarily as a search engine for ideas with the following usage traits: transactional use and illusory understanding. Regarding the perceived benefits, the students appreciated the importance of GenAI tools in enhancing academic skills development, such as academic writing, translation, and self-directed learning. They also acknowledged GenAI tools' role in boosting productivity in routine tasks by optimizing efforts and enhancing efficiency. In creative tasks, they saved time, offered diverse and innovative ideas, and boosted motivation and confidence.
However, the perceived drawbacks included concerns about ethical use, a lack of clear guidelines, limited capabilities, overreliance on GenAI, and potential skills erosion. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers These findings will help educators guide students in developing metacognitive awareness and refining their use of GenAI tools while addressing the potential risks. Emphasis should be placed on understanding the distinct patterns of GenAI use, which will enable practitioners to scaffold learners. Integration also requires developing innovative strategies through redesigning lessons and activities and carefully selecting adequate assessment methods that foster critical thinking. Additionally, it is important to enhance learners' skills in effective intellectual communication through GenAI tools, to guide them in evaluating AI- generated content, and to provide ethical frameworks for responsible AI use. Researchers need to explore more innovative strategies to integrate GenAI tools into higher education, in line with the nature of the various disciplines, to use GenAI tools as intellectual partners and not superficially. The field requires further studies to investigate how GenAI tools can be integrated to develop students' intellectual skills, preparing them for future roles that demand advanced abilities and effective use of GenAI for personal and professional growth. Impact on Society This study revealed that the use of GenAI tools has many benefits at the level of individuals in society when interacting with AI tools at an intellectual level. However, the superficial use of GenAI tools may contribute to spreading ignorance and an illusory sense of achievement, which may harm societies. Accordingly, it is necessary to warn users and take necessary measures to avoid superficial and harmful use of GenAI tools by raising individuals' awareness about the effective ways of interacting with GenAI tools and the importance of avoiding overreliance on them without evaluating GenAI outputs. Future Research As several drawbacks associated with GenAI tools have emerged, including superficial technology use and the potential erosion of skills, future studies should explore this aspect and its impact on learning in greater depth. Future studies could employ a mixed-methods study design with a larger sample encompassing both males and females to enhance the generalizability of the findings.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Peer assessment has been recognised as a sustainable and scalable assessment method that promotes higher-order learning and provides students with fast and detailed feedback on their work. Despite these benefits, some common concerns and criticisms are associated with the use of peer assessments (eg, scarcity of high-quality feedback from peer student-assessors and lack of accuracy in assigning a grade to the assessee) that raise questions about their trustworthiness. Consequently, many instructors and educational institutions have been anxious about incorporating peer assessment into their teaching. This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on how AI and learning analytics may be incorporated to address some of the common concerns associated with peer assessment systems, which in turn can increase their trustworthiness and adoption. In particular, we present and evaluate our AI-assisted and analytical approaches that aim to (1) offer guidelines and assistance to student-assessors during individual reviews to provide better feedback, (2) integrate probabilistic and text analysis inference models to improve the accuracy of the assigned grades, (3) develop feedback on reviews strategies that enable peer assessors to review the work of each other, and (4) employ a spot-checking mechanism to assist instructors in optimally overseeing the peer assessment process.

T2  - INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - The launch of OpenAI ChatGPT's language-generation model has raised alarms within many sectors, especially the academic sector. Several academicians have urged universities to develop new forms of assessment after the launch of ChatGPT, which solves academic questions in less than a few minutes. Academic cheating is not a new phenomenon, and the use of AI-generated text to cheat on assignments is a new type of cheating that poses unique challenges. This study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for topic modeling and the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) method for sentiment analysis. After data preprocessing, 3870 tweets were still available out of the originally 10,000 tweets that were extracted for the study. The VADER sentiment analysis results revealed that 2013 tweets were categorized as "positive," with the remaining 804 and 1053 tweets categorized as "negative" and "neutral." The analysis's findings indicate that the majority of people have favorable things to say about ChatGPT. As a result, educational institutions can mitigate the disruptive effects of this technology and promote academic integrity by developing clear policies and guidelines and designing assessments that include limited AI-generated text.

AB  - At present, ChatGPT is penetrating all spheres of human activities, and especially education is no exception. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the potentials and pitfalls of using ChatGPT for academic purposes among university students, as well as provide relevant pedagogical implications for its use in academia. The methodology is based on a mix-method approach, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative by analysing an online questionnaire that was distributed among both Czech and foreign students at a university in the Czech Republic. The findings of this study reveal ChatGPT's burgeoning significance as an academic instrument, alongside concerns regarding its constraints and potential misuse. Most students employ ChatGPT for academic purposes, as demonstrated by the favorable feedback it receives for its effectiveness in facilitating research, stimulating idea generation, promoting comprehension of intricate concepts, and furnishing prompt responses. Hence, ChatGPT embodies promise for forthcoming generations regarding its capacity to augment educational programs, potentially fostering greater efficiency and interactivity in the learning process. Nevertheless, a critical apprehension lies in students excessively relying on ChatGPT, which may impede the cultivation of vital skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Therefore, the authors of this study provide several pedagogical implications for its use in academia, such as using ChatGPT as a supportive tool in classes, as well as using it for collaborative work and group tasks since ChatGPT promotes sharing information, faster collection of data, providing diverse and creative ideas, or speed communication. Another important pedagogical implication is raising awareness of ethical guidelines, given that many students remain oblivious to them, necessitating the training of teachers to impart ethical usage of ChatGPT. Finally, the results of this study align with several educational theories, such as constructivism or self-determination theory.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOLS
AB  - This study examines the integration of ChatGPT into English language learning by exploring students' experiences of using ChatGPT during the writing process. Adopting a convergent mixed-method design, the research involved students enrolled in the ICT for ELT course at a university in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, and applied the Technology Acceptance Model to explore the relationships among key variables. Ninety-five English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students participated in a four-week take-home assignment using a writing prompt provided by their lecturer. Qualitative data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire, which revealed that students' acceptance of ChatGPT was attributed to its user-friendly interface and ability to interact in their native language. Path analysis revealed that perceived ease of use positively influenced both perceived usefulness and attitude toward change, while perceived usefulness also positively affected attitude toward change. In turn, a positive attitude toward changes significantly impacted students' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT. Integrating qualitative and quantitative findings, this study suggests that ChatGPT fostered a positive attitude toward technological change and encouraged students to adopt it more frequently. Notably, students primarily used ChatGPT as a writing aid rather than for generating complete essays, suggesting the potential for using ChatGPT under instructor supervision to diminish risks of dishonesty in academic writing.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Introduction Building upon previous research, this study aims to provide answers to the questions of how the presence of a humanoid artificial pedagogical agent as teacher and instructor and visual self-other representation of the learners through avatars influence the immediate cognitive performance and learning experience in online learning among adult learners.Methods Several outcome measures were investigated to evaluate if effects are the same or different for the different experimental conditions and if learning with the pedagogical agent and visual self-other representation is modulated by the learner's previous experiences with and preferences for online learning. Teacher presence and self-other presence of the learners were experimentally manipulated. A humanoid artificial agent, visible on all of the slides of the online course material and instructing the material represented the teacher. The avatars of the learners (self-avatar and peer avatars) were kept of minimal functionality but self-avatars were preselected or could be self-selected by the learners. The learner's cognitive learning performance, the learner's attention to the pedagogical agent, their sense of teacher presence and of self- and other-presence, their satisfaction with the course as well as the learner's previous learning experiences were measured by cognitive testing, self-report, and linguistic analysis as major performance indicators and a positive learning experience. The analysis comprised 133 university students and results were additionally compared for two subsamples.Results Learning performance, learning satisfaction, and the attention paid to the teacher were positively related. In addition, positive evaluations of the cognitive presence elicited by the teacher were found. Self- or other-presence of avatars did not significantly influence the learner's performance beyond teacher presence but the learner's perception of it and their motivation to study online.Discussion The study and its results extend the previous literature that focused on the effects of pedagogical agents in online teaching or on virtual representations of the learner's self and classmates in online learning. Despite limitations, the results of this study provide insights into combining teaching with artificial pedagogical agents and visual avatars for self-other representation during online teaching and the observations can serve as catalyst for future research.

TI  - What influences college students using AI for academic writing? - A quantitative analysis based on HISAM and TRI theory
AU  - Cui, Y.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely adopted as tools for academic writing, sparking interest in the factors that influence their adoption. However, existing research has predominantly focused on cognitive factors, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, while giving insufficient attention to emotional motivations (e.g., perceived enjoyment, emotional engagement) in students' use of AI tools. This gap has led to a somewhat oversimplified or incomplete understanding of the factors influencing students' adoption of AI technologies. This study constructs a theoretical framework based on the Hedonic Information System Acceptance Model (HISAM) and the Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data from 148 university students. The study finds that students' intention to use AI tools is influenced not only by cognitive evaluations, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, but also by emotional factors, including technological optimism and perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment, as a positive emotional factor in the interaction process, significantly promotes students' usage intention. Additionally, technological optimism, as a positive aspect of technology readiness, has a direct positive effect on perceived enjoyment. Furthermore, although negative experiences such as technical discomfort and insecurity have a minor impact on the evaluation of AI tool functionality, they still affect students' emotional experiences, thereby influencing their usage intention. The study suggests that future AI tool designs should prioritize enhancing students' emotional experiences by providing personalized feedback and optimizing user interfaces to improve ease of use. Moreover, increasing the tool's interpretability and transparency can help reduce the risks of misuse, such as academic dishonesty or a decline in learning ability, which may arise from negative emotional experiences. © 2025 The Author

AB  - This study examines the determinants of the sustainable use of artificial intelligence (AI) among university professors in Peru. This research adopted a quantitative approach through a cross-sectional empirical–explanatory study, employing a structural equation model. Data were collected from 368 professors from eight Peruvian universities using a structured questionnaire that assessed six main constructs: attitude toward AI, prejudice against AI, facilitating conditions, use of AI, teaching concerns, and ethical perception. While the results reveal significant correlational relationships—with attitude toward AI, facilitating conditions, and prejudice against AI showing a significant association with its sustainable use, and the use of AI showing a significant relationship with professors’ ethical perceptions—the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes causal inferences. No significant relationship was found between the use of AI and teaching concerns. Additionally, demographic variables such as gender and age did not exhibit significant moderating effects. These findings contribute to understanding the factors related to the sustainable adoption of AI in higher education and provide valuable insights for the development of effective institutional strategies in the Latin American context. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Freely accessible generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) poses challenges to physiology education regarding learning and academic integrity. Although many studies have explored the capabilities of GenAI to complete assessments, few have implemented educative activities to highlight GenAI risks and benefits or explored physiology students' perceptions and uses of GenAI. Our study implemented a learning activity, designed using constructivist principles, to allow physiology students to explore GenAI and consider its use in assessment tasks. The activity engaged students (n = 236) enrolled in a second-year physiology subject over 2 years. The activity began with students being directed to critique a sample exam answer as a form of content revision. The answer had been covertly generated by ChatGPT, and it lacked depth and contained some hallucinated facts. Students then engaged in discussion about the use of GenAI for university study and assessment. Questions were used to stimulate thought and discussion, and student responses were collected via Padlet (492 posts). Thematic analysis of the comments highlighted students' beliefs about using GenAI and perceived benefits and risks. There was a general trend of increasing acceptance of using GenAI, and using it for assessment, over time. Students were concerned about breaching academic integrity guidelines, information accuracy and sources, and the negative effect it might have on their learning. At the conclusion of the activity, the revelation that ChatGPT wrote the sample exam answer reinforced the need for responsible GenAI use.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Constructivist learning tenets were used to guide the design of a critical evaluation learning activity about GenAI, to enable physiology students to make informed decisions regarding the use of GenAI in their learning and assessment. The trend of increasing acceptance of GenAI coincided with increasing student beliefs about uses of GenAI being perceived as responsible. Student concerns about academic integrity and ethical considerations persisted, yet academic misconduct cases increased.

AB  - Integrating generative AI (GAI) into higher education is crucial for preparing a future generation of GAI-literate students. However, a comprehensive understanding of global institutional adoption policies remains absent, with most prior studies focusing on the Global North and lacking a theoretical lens. This study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to examine GAI adoption strategies in higher education across 40 universities from six global regions. It explores the characteristics of GAI innovation, including compatibility, trialability, and observability, and analyses the communication channels and roles and responsibilities outlined in university policies and guidelines. The findings reveal that universities are proactively addressing GAI integration by emphasising academic integrity, enhancing teaching and learning practices, and promoting equity. Key policy measures include the development of guidelines for ethical GAI use, the design of authentic assessments to mitigate misuse, and the provision of training programs for faculty and students to foster GAI literacy. Despite these efforts, gaps remain in comprehensive policy frameworks, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns and ensuring equitable access to GAI tools. The study underscores the importance of clear communication channels, stakeholder collaboration, and ongoing evaluation to support effective GAI adoption. These insights provide actionable insights for policymakers to craft inclusive, transparent, and adaptive strategies for integrating GAI into higher education. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Written assignments for large classes pose a far more significant challenge in the age of the GenAI revolution. Suggestions such as oral exams and formative assessments are not always feasible with many students in a class. Therefore, we conducted a study in South Africa and involved 280 Honors students to explore the usefulness of Turnitin's AI detector in conjunction with student self-reflection. Using a Mixed Methods Research (MMR) approach, we analysed data generated from the Turnitin AI reports, our grading rubrics, and qualitative student self-reflection. The findings show that incorporating self-reflection into assessments supports ethical GenAI use and improves the transparency lecturers need for decision-making. A declaration form allowed the students to be upfront about using Generative Artificial Intelligence tools. We found that students who can reflect on their learning relied less on generated content. However, students with high AI detected scores (> 20%) did not adequately reflect on how the tools supported their learning and could not give credible explanations of use. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing students and academics with examples of responsibly handling AI-detected scores in large-class settings. We present a guided self-reflection and declaration with an AI detector to support students and help lecturers make decisions when grading. We also present a decision tree that lecturers and graders can use when evaluating AI use in assessments. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Education for Chemical Engineers
AB  - With the recent and rapid growth of the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including the use of large language models (LLMs) there has been growing concern amongst higher education institutions regarding assessment, potential plagiarism, and ultimately a negative impact on student learning outcomes. However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output. As such, this work provides not just a case study for the integration of LLMs, and GAI more broadly, into chemical engineering curricula, but also valuable insight into student perceptions regarding the use of this nascent technology more generally. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in higher education, widely adopted by both students and faculty for tasks ranging from writing to coding. Despite its growing usage, concerns over academic integrity and its long-term impact on learning persist. While educational institutions are developing policies to guide responsible Gen AI use, these measures often fail to prepare students for the realities of workplace applications. This qualitative study explores the gap between academic and professional usage of Gen AI through structured interviews with two groups: 20 faculty members and 20 industry professionals. Descriptive analysis of the data revealed a significant disconnect between pedagogical and industry practices, potentially leaving students underprepared for workplace demands. Faculty noted Gen AI's ability to assist in course-specific assignments but expressed concerns about over-reliance and ethical implications. Industry professionals emphasized its role in increasing efficiency through technical documentation, data processing, and decision-making, while identifying challenges like data security and ethical use. To address these issues, the study recommends a systemic approach that integrates hands-on Gen AI training, ethical instruction, and industry-aligned curricula into higher education. This approach includes embedding AI education into general education requirements and faculty development programs to ensure comprehensive preparedness. Additionally, collaborative projects, internships, and strategic partnerships with industry and accrediting bodies are essential to aligning curricula with workforce demands. Together, these efforts can equip students with the technical skills and ethical awareness needed to navigate and contribute effectively to AI-driven workplaces. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) has brought opportunities and challenges for higher education as it integrates into teaching and learning environments. As instructors navigate this new landscape, understanding their engagement with and attitudes toward GenAI is crucial. We surveyed 178 instructors from a single U.S. university to examine their current practices, perceptions, trust, and distrust of GenAI in higher education in March 2024. While most surveyed instructors reported moderate to high familiarity with GenAI-related concepts, their actual use of GenAI tools for direct instructional tasks remained limited. Our quantitative results show that trust and distrust in GenAI are related yet distinct; high trust does not necessarily imply low distrust, and vice versa. We also found significant differences in surveyed instructors' familiarity with GenAI across different trust and distrust groups. Our qualitative results show nuanced manifestations of trust and distrust among surveyed instructors and various approaches to support calibrated trust in GenAI. We discuss practical implications focused on (dis)trust calibration among instructors. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - This research explores postgraduate students' attitudes and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in academic writing, using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Guided by the mixed method approach, quantitative and qualitative measures like questionnaires and interviews were adopted to gather data from postgraduate students. Descriptive statistical tools like frequencies, means and SD were used to analyze responses from 339 postgraduate students, focusing on the perceived usefulness and actual usage of AI tools in their writing endeavors. The findings, presented through means and standard deviations, indicate an overall positive attitude towards AI tools. The students perceive AI as beneficial for improving grammar, preventing plagiarism, generating ideas, and enhancing overall writing proficiency. However, a lack of consensus is evident, with varied responses and inflated standard deviations suggesting differing opinions among respondents. Subjective norms play a crucial role in influencing students' decisions to use AI tools. Friends, colleagues, and lecturers significantly influence their perception and adoption of AI tools in academic writing. Although cautioned about excessive reliance, the influence of positive testimonials contributes to the widespread adoption of AI tools among postgraduate students. In terms of actual usage, the study reveals that postgraduate students frequently employ AI tools, primarily for idea development, spelling checks, paraphrasing, coherence, and searching for relevant literature. While some students appreciate the convenience and time-saving aspects of AI, others express concerns about potential detrimental effects on critical thinking and creativity. In conclusion, the research underscores the varied attitudes and usage patterns of postgraduate students regarding AI tools in academic writing. While many acknowledge the benefits, caution is advised to prevent overdependence and preserve critical thinking skills. The findings contribute valuable insights for educators and institutions seeking to integrate AI tools effectively into postgraduate education. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Introduction: The introduction highlights the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on higher education (HE), emphasising its potential to enhance student learning and instructor efficiency while also addressing significant challenges such as accuracy, privacy, and ethical concerns. By exploring the benefits and risks of AI integration, the introduction underscores the urgent need for evidence-based, inclusive, and adaptable frameworks to guide universities in leveraging GenAI responsibly and effectively in academic environments. Aims: This paper presents a comprehensive process for developing cross-disciplinary and consensus-based guidelines, based on the latest evidence for the integration of GenAI at European University Cyprus (EUC). In response to the rapid adoption of AI tools such as LLMs in HE, a task group at EUC created a structured framework to guide the ethical and effective use of GenAI in academia, one that was intended to be flexible enough to incorporate new developments and not infringe on instructors' academic freedoms, while also addressing ethical and practical concerns. Results: The framework development was informed by extensive literature reviews and consultations. Key pillars of the framework include: addressing the risks and opportunities presented by GenAI; promoting transparent communication; ensuring responsible use by students and educators; safeguarding academic integrity. The guidelines emphasise the balance between, on the one hand, leveraging AI to enhance educational experiences, and, on the other maintaining critical thinking and originality. The framework also includes practical recommendations for AI usage, classroom integration, and policy formulation, ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces human judgement in educational settings. Conclusions: The iterative development process, including the use of GenAI tools for refining the guidelines, illustrates a hands-on approach to AI adoption in HE, and the resulting guidelines may serve as a model for other higher education institutions (HEIs) aiming to integrate AI tools while upholding educational quality and ethical standards. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores the perception of artificial intelligence (AI)-based Chatbots, specifically Open AI's ChatGPT use, among physics students in four universities in Ghana, Jordan, and the United States. We utilized a survey instrument adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to elicit responses from 804 students. TAM constructs: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Subjective Norms (SN), Attitude Towards Technology Use (ATU), Behavioral Intention (BI), and User Behavior (UB) were assessed. We also assessed perceptions of ethical use (EU) and student learning outcomes (SLO) using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. A measurement model had good fit indices and validated most hypotheses. A path analysis (PA) for hypothesized relationships suggested PEU and SN are significant predictors of BI and UB, whereas PU's influence on BI was indirect. Significantly, EU concerns negatively moderated the relationship between BI and UB, suggesting that higher ethical concerns can reduce ChatGPT usage. Cross-cultural analysis uncovered significant differences in perceptions and usage patterns influenced by institutional policies, academic levels, and demographic factors. Our findings affirm TAM's robustness in predicting technology use across various cultural and institutional settings. Findings also underscore the crucial roles of social influence in fostering positive user behaviors for Chat GPT. This study provides insights for educators and policymakers to develop strategies for integrating AI Chatbots responsibly and effectively in collegiate physics education while addressing ethical concerns. A longitudinal survey of the relationships between consistent AI Chatbot use, institutional support, student motivation, and learning outcomes is recommended. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - Nurse Education in Practice
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to explore the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students' use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their studies, examining how this usage shapes their learning experiences and perceptions of traditional pedagogical approaches. Background: The integration of AI into healthcare is rapidly transforming clinical practice, which in turn necessitates a corresponding shift in nursing education. While AI's potential benefits and challenges in education are widely discussed, limited research has focused on how nursing students specifically use these tools in their nursing studies and how this impacts their learning processes. Design: A qualitative study employing exploratory and descriptive designs. Methods: Participants were recruited from an undergraduate nursing program at a tertiary university. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data. Results: Key findings revealed that nursing students use AI for personalized learning, bridging the theory-practice gap and managing time constraints. International students particularly found AI valuable for cultural adaptation and language support. A significant finding was the “open secret” of AI use, with students actively using tools despite institutional discouragement, highlighting a disconnect between student needs and institutional practices. Ethical concerns, such as bias, data privacy and accountability, were also prominent. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into the student-driven demand for AI integration in nursing education. It highlights the need for institutional responsiveness, transparency and the development of ethical AI frameworks. By acknowledging student agency and fostering collaborative dialogue, nursing education can leverage AI's benefits effectively while upholding the profession's core values: compassion, empathy and human-centered care. © 2025 The Authors

T2  - Information and Learning Science
AB  - Purpose: Large language models such as ChatGPT are a challenge to academic principles, calling into question well-established practices, teaching and exam formats. This study aims to explore the adaptation process regarding text-generative artificial intelligence (AI) of students and teachers in higher education and to identify needs for change. Design/methodology/approach: The issue is explored in a mixed-methods approach based on Domestication Theory (Silverstone et al., 1992; Silverstone, 1994), incorporating views of both teaching staff and students. Both statistical and content analyses were carried out. Findings: The results show that both students and teachers are conflicted about generative AI and its usage. Trepidation and fear stand against a general feeling that AI is an integral part of the future and needs to be embraced. Both groups show marked needs for training and rules and offer a variety of ideas for new exam formats. Originality/value: This study provides a unique insight by exploring the attitudes and usage intentions regarding generative AI of two stakeholder groups: students and teachers. Its results can be of significant use to institutions deciding on their strategy regarding AI. It illustrates attitudes and usage intentions as well as needs of both groups. In addition, ideas for new assessment and teaching formats were generated. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of the freely accessible artificial intelligence chatbots (AICB) that might disrupt the teaching and learning pattern in higher education. While some education stakeholders developed strong opposition towards the AICB usage, condemning it as academic dishonesty, there are others believe the AICB might even improve the students’ learning. A total of 160 urban college students were purposively selected and requested to respond to the scales of ChatGPT acceptance and trust, academic self-efficacy, and university mattering to test the hypothesis that the acceptance and trust towards AICB should improve academic self-efficacy and general mattering among the students. The results indicated that academic self-efficacy partially mediates the contribution of AICB on the societal mattering. In other words, the findings suggest that students who trust and accept AICB usage would likely to believe that they can perform academically better and therefore they feel they are more meaningful to the society. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2025, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

T2  - European Journal of Educational Research
AB  - This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) integration on students' educational experiences. It investigates student perceptions of AI across various academic aspects, such as module outlines, learning outcomes, curriculum design, instructional activities, assessments, and feedback mechanisms. It evaluates the impact of AI on students' learning experiences, critical thinking, self-assessment, cognitive development, and academic integrity. This research used a structured survey distributed to 300 students through Microsoft Forms 365, yet the response rate was 29.67%. A structured survey and thematic analysis were employed to gather insights from 89 students. Thematic analysis is a qualitative method for identifying and analysing patterns or themes within data, providing insights into key ideas and trends. The limited response rate may be attributed to learners' cultural backgrounds, as not all students are interested in research or familiar with AI tools. The survey questions are about AI integration in different academic areas. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and themes within the data. Benefits such as enhanced critical thinking, timely feedback, and personalised learning experiences are prevalent. AI tools like Turnitin supported academic integrity, and platforms like ChatGPT and Grammarly were particularly valued for their utility in academic tasks. The study acknowledges limitations linked to the small sample size and a focus on undergraduate learners only. The findings suggest that AI can significantly improve educational experiences. AI provides tailored support and promotes ethical practices. This study recommends continued and expanded use of AI technologies in education while addressing potential implementation challenges. © 2025 The Author(s).

T2  - International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy
AB  - This paper aims to study the opinions of teachers and students regarding the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in programming education. The research combines quantitative data from Likert-scale questions with qualitative data from open-ended responses. The findings reveal similarities between students’ and teachers’ views on the advantages of using ChatGPT in programming education and its potential to develop soft skills. A difference appears in assessing the attitudes of both groups toward the disadvantages of integrating ChatGPT in education. Compared to students, teachers express much greater concern about the negative effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on academic integrity and teaching quality. The results showed that both groups positively evaluate ChatGPT as a supplementary tool in education. They believe it should complement traditional teacher-student communication rather than replace it. Based on the research findings, the authors recommend that the integration of ChatGPT into education should be preceded by adopting university AI usage policies and training for the effective use of ChatGPT. Pedagogical guidelines for integrating ChatGPT into programming education are proposed to minimise the effect of students’ over-reliance on AI and achieve the learning outcomes defined by Bloom’s Taxonomy. © 2025 by the authors of this article.

AB  - This study explores the use of ChatGPT among Library and Information Science (LIS) students at the University of Delhi. A structured online survey with 13 questions (both closed and open-ended) was conducted via Google Forms in March 2024. The survey link was shared through the official WhatsApp group for BLISc and MLISc students of the University of Delhi’s Department of Library and Information Science, as well as individually through personal WhatsApp accounts of the 2023-2024 academic year, yielding a 79.36 % response rate from 100 participants. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data revealed that ChatGPT is widely recognised. Students primarily use ChatGPT for assignments, valuing its free access, quick responses, and idea-generation capabilities. Most respondents find its information somewhat accurate (61.9 %), and 66 % are likely to recommend it for academic purposes. The most cited advantage (67 %) is its free, 24/7 availability. However, 56.3 % are concerned about overreliance on AI. Additionally, 89.7 % note the absence of institutional policies on AI use, and 85.6 % have yet to receive faculty recommendations to use ChatGPT for academic or research work to ensure academic and research integrity. The findings will aid the university in developing policies to integrate AI tools in academia effectively. © 2025, DESIDOC.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education, including how students approach examinations. This study addresses the growing reliance on AI in academic settings and its implications for learning and assessment integrity. The study aimed to analyze student reliance on AI in finding answers to midterm and final exams at the Ibnu Rusyd College of Tarbiyah (IRCT) Tanah Grogot, Indonesia. The research employed a mixed-methods approach through a survey of 98 Islamic Education Study Program students and interviews with 5 lecturers and 20 students. Data were analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis. The results show that 70% of the students utilized AI occasionally or frequently to complete exams, citing efficiency and ease of access. However, only 30% of the students felt that the use of AI supported an in-depth understanding of the material. Conversely, the lecturers highlighted that the overuse of AI risks reducing students' analytical skills. Quantitative analysis showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.45) between AI use and academic outcomes, while regression analysis revealed that other factors, such as lecturer guidance and learning motivation, were more significant in influencing academic success. This study recommends establishing clear institutional policies to regulate AI use, including a proctoring system in technology-based exams and the implementation of project-based learning to reduce student dependency on AI. Additionally, this study contributes novel insights into the ethical considerations of AI use in education and suggests that future research should explore the long-term behavioral impacts of AI reliance on student learning outcomes. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (ai) technology is revolutionizing the way we live, learn, and work. In academic settings, tools such as chatbots, machine translation, and plagiarism detectors are becoming increasingly popular. However, as students’ use of these technologies becomes widespread, concerns about the impact it may have on learning, academic integrity, and the role of traditional teaching methods are growing. This paper aims to explore the perspectives of Argentinean teachers on the use of ai in higher education and on its advantages and drawbacks. Through an exploratory qualitative approach, we investigated how much knowledge teachers have about ai and whether they perceive its potential benefits and challenges and its impact on their teaching practices. Results show that L2 instructors exhibit low levels of familiarity and experience with these resources, specifically generative machine translation (gmt) and chat generative pre-trained transformer (gpt). Although some of the interviewees showed positive attitudes towards incorporating these tools into their classes, we also identify their fears and skepticism about these resources in higher education, their concerns about fairness and responsibility, and the lack of knowledge to engage with the software in teaching practices. The study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing efl instructors’ varied perspectives on ai, which is crucial for effectively integrating these technologies into L2 education. © (2025), (Universidad de Antioquia).

AB  - Background: Interest has recently increased in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Although the publicly available GenAI tools are not specifically trained in the medical domain, they have demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of medical assessments. The future integration of GenAI in medicine remains unknown. However, the rapid availability of GenAI with a chat interface and the potential risks and benefits are the focus of great interest. As with any significant medical advancement or change, medical schools must adapt their curricula to equip students with the skills necessary to become successful physicians. Furthermore, medical schools must ensure that faculty members have the skills to harness these new opportunities to increase their effectiveness as educators. How medical schools currently fulfill their responsibilities is unclear. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) in the United States currently train a significant proportion of the total number of medical students. These COMs are in academic settings ranging from large public research universities to small private institutions. Therefore, studying COMs will offer a representative sample of the current GenAI integration in medical education. Objective: This study aims to describe the policies and training regarding the specific aspect of GenAI in US COMs, targeting students, faculty, and administrators. Methods: Web-based surveys were sent to deans and Student Government Association (SGA) presidents of the main campuses of fully accredited US COMs. The dean survey included questions regarding current and planned policies and training related to GenAI for students, faculty, and administrators. The SGA president survey included only those questions related to current student policies and training. Results: Responses were received from 81% (26/32) of COMs surveyed. This included 47% (15/32) of the deans and 50% (16/32) of the SGA presidents (with 5 COMs represented by both the deans and the SGA presidents). Most COMs did not have a policy on the student use of GenAI, as reported by the dean (14/15, 93%) and the SGA president (14/16, 88%). Of the COMs with no policy, 79% (11/14) had no formal plans for policy development. Only 1 COM had training for students, which focused entirely on the ethics of using GenAI. Most COMs had no formal plans to provide mandatory (11/14, 79%) or elective (11/15, 73%) training. No COM had GenAI policies for faculty or administrators. Eighty percent had no formal plans for policy development. Furthermore, 33.3% (5/15) of COMs had faculty or administrator GenAI training. Except for examination question development, there was no training to increase faculty or administrator capabilities and efficiency or to decrease their workload. Conclusions: The survey revealed that most COMs lack GenAI policies and training for students, faculty, and administrators. The few institutions with policies or training were extremely limited in scope. Most institutions without current training or policies had no formal plans for development. The lack of current policies and training initiatives suggests inadequate preparedness for integrating GenAI into the medical school environment, therefore, relegating the responsibility for ethical guidance and training to the individual COM member. © Tsunagu Ichikawa, Elizabeth Olsen, Arathi Vinod, Noah Glenn, Karim Hanna, Gregg C Lund, Stacey Pierce-Talsma.

Even though AI in education has been investigated by many researchers, the current state of AI use in Uzbekistan’s higher education remains under-researched. For this reason, the main goal of this article is to determine lecturers’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in Foreign Language Teaching (FLT) classes and explore the challenges that arose during the process. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining qualitative and quantitative data from semi-structured interviews conducted among seven university EFL teachers. The interview data were processed using thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes. In terms of validation, the research followed multiple stages, including careful participant selection based on experience with ChatGPT, cross-verification of transcripts, and coding to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings. The study’s findings revealed that teachers’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in EFL teaching were mainly positive, emphasizing its benefits such as providing students with real-time feedback, improving their autonomous learning skills, and features for checking grammar and spelling. However, participants also reported concerns such as over-reliance on AI assistance, a lack of students’ ethical knowledge in using AI in learning, and the negative influence of ChatGPT on students’ critical thinking skills. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge by offering insights into how lecturers perceive ChatGPT in higher education. This paper also highlights the main implications and limitations of the research. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to enhance the educational experience, its use also presents challenges. This research examines the use and misuse of AI tools for university-related tasks. We surveyed 498 students from three faculties at a large European university to, first, identify factors driving their willingness to use AI tools for university-related tasks, and, second, estimate the prevalence of cheating behavior involving the unauthorized use of AI tools in examinations. Specifically, we tested and extended the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) by identifying trust and perceived opportunity costs as additional determinants of using AI tools for university-related tasks. To estimate the proportion of students cheating during examinations, we applied a randomized response technique. We discuss the results with respect to the effective and appropriate implementation of AI tools in higher education. Our findings can help educators and policymakers to promote responsible AI use while mitigating its misuse. © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T2  - Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment
AB  - Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into nursing practice has the potential to transform healthcare delivery. However, understanding the factors influencing nursing students’ readiness to adopt AI is essential for effective implementation. This study aimed to explore the behavioral intentions of nursing students to use AI by examining the interplay of ethical awareness, digital literacy, moral sensitivity, attitudes, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social influence. A descriptive cross-sectional methodological design was used to recruit 460 nursing students from two governmental universities in Jordan. Data were collected using validated self-administered questionnaires and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the interrelationships among the variables. Findings revealed that positive attitudes (β = 0.43, p <.001), digital literacy (β = 0.40, p <.001), self-efficacy (β = 0.36, p <.001), and AI ethical awareness (β = 0.31, p <.001) were significant predictors of behavioral intention to use AI. Participation in AI workshops and social support also positively influenced intentions, while negative attitudes (β = -0.29, p <.001) and anxiety (β = -0.15, p <.001) served as barriers. Together, these factors accounted for 47% of the variance in behavioral intention (R2 = 0.47). In this scope, educational institutions should prioritize AI-focused training and ethics curricula, while healthcare policymakers should develop robust guidelines and invest in educational resources to prepare a workforce equipped for AI-integrated healthcare. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T2  - International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
AB  - Artificial intelligence is increasingly implemented in higher education, offering customized interventions and timely feedback to enhance learning experiences. While these tools have the potential to improve educational outcomes, they also introduce ethical risks and sociotechnical implications such as reduced learner autonomy. Current ethical discussions often focus on computational issues and overlook the nuanced impacts from students’ perspectives, which may increase students’ vulnerability. Taking a student-centered approach, we apply the Story Completion Method to investigate students’ concerns about adopting analytics-based AI tools in education. Seventy-one participants responded to the story prompts, which we analyzed qualitatively to uncover perceptions about how these tools may reshape pedagogical aspects such as learner autonomy, learning environments and approaches, interactions and relationships, and pedagogical roles. Our findings reveal that these potential impacts not only occur in isolation but also interact with one another. This study makes two primary contributions: first, it marks a novel application of the speculative design method to explore students’ perceptions of AIEd tools. Second, it provides a qualitative analysis of key themes derived from student responses, offering design implications for AIEd systems that are sensitive to student concerns and ethical considerations. These insights offer a foundation for future research and contribute to a more student-centered approach to the ethical development of AIEd. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2024.

AB  - The rise of AI in higher education offers significant opportunities for streamlining learning outcomes, operational efficiency, and even institutional progress. Besides personalized learning systems, the adoption of AI should integrate these ethical, and sometimes even legal, frameworks. The student's engagement and academic performance can be best improved with adaptive learning technologies and predictive analytics. Also, included in the study are; identification and exploration of limits, such as challenges faced by emerging technologies, meaning that students need to be cautious. Data breaches, biases in algorithms, scarce resources, and resistance to change will work as unique obstacles; hence, suggestions presented will be quite specific to each of these themes. Higher education will undergo transformative changes, traversing from inclusivity and innovation through the mechanisms of stronger governance, capacity building, and international cooperation; with AI, such pathways are possible. Such discoveries underscore the importance of developing interdisciplinary research capable of generating both transparent and effective frameworks. This would ensure that the longer-term impact of AI utilization is harmonized with educational and societal targets. © 2025, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - This qualitative study explores graduate students’ perceptions of using a generative AI-powered research application, COREI, and its impact on their sense of intellectual and scholarly ethics. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with graduate students (n = 10), four doctoral and six masters’, from a large research university in Western Canada. Participants were given access to COREI for one month and encouraged to use its features in their research projects. Thematic analysis of the interview data revealed four main themes: (1) academic integrity and generative AI collaboration, (2) agency in the generative AI-assisted research process, (3) authorship and the personalization of AI-generated content, and (4) originality through generative AI-assisted research. Although some participants initially expressed concerns about the potential for AI to compromise academic integrity, many came to view COREI as a collaborative tool that, when used responsibly, could enhance their research without infringing upon their scholarly ethics. Participants emphasized the importance of human agency and decision-making in the AI-assisted research process, and the need for critical evaluation and personalization of AI-generated content to maintain authorship. Originality emerged as a collaborative feat between human expertise and AI’s generative capabilities. The findings suggest a need for reconceptualizing traditional notions of agency, authorship, and originality in the context of AI-assisted research. The study highlights the importance of developing ethical frameworks and institutional policies that prioritize human agency and critical engagement with AI-generated content, while also emphasizing the need for further research on the long-term impacts of generative AI on intellectual and scholarly ethics. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students’ behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students’ BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER. These findings can help university students better accept and ethically use generative AI products. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T2  - Journal of Nursing Education
AB  - Background: Complex educational challenges emerge during Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) dissertation research, yet many newly hired faculty receive little preparation for the role of dissertation supervisor. The intensity and rigor of dissertation supervision are not reflected in workload calculations based on enrollments or clock hours. New faculty have few venues beyond personal experience to learn the challenges that supervision entails. Method: This article presents reflections of two research methodologists who supervise students in a nursing science PhD program in a large research university. It explores several challenges and dilemmas that characterize the supervision process. Results: Challenges of supervision involve dynamics of power, authority, and reputational self-protection, which reflect the paradoxical nature of the dissertation process, the distinct structure of graduate nursing education, nonlinear trajectories of doctoral learning, and risks related to the growth of generative artificial intelligence. Conclusion: Newly hired faculty need to be prepared for the unique challenges of supervising student research. © 2025 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

AB  - The perceived ease of use around artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT has created an ostensible moral and technological panic around how AI technologies are transforming higher education. This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model to suggest ‘perceived ease of use’ is both a factor in acceptance and panic around emerging technologies. We provide a qualitative analysis of statements, guides, and policies about AI and ChatGPT from 148 U.S. universities to argue that there is not so much a panic happening in higher education as there is a concerted effort to negotiate and integrate artificial intelligence into classroom, research, and daily operations. Across four different categories of statements – university policies, teaching and learning resources, library guides, and professor statements – we find recurring values emphasizing usefulness as well as navigating ethical concerns. ChatGPT’s perceived ease of use has led higher education faculty and staff to avoid panic discourses and focus on problem-solving discourses as they negotiate its institutionalization. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - Academic misconduct is a prevalent issue in higher education with detrimental effects on the individual students, rigor of the program, and strength of the workplace. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated concern over academic integrity and the potential use and misuse of AI. However, there is a lack of research on academic integrity in doctoral dissertations. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to explore academic misconduct in dissertations, specifically investigating the prevalence of AI use and plagiarism. Considering debate over the accuracy of technology in detecting AI-generated text, dissertations were also analyzed from before widespread AI availability, as a point of comparison. A sample of 200 dissertations from 2013 and 2023 were analyzed through Turnitin to flag plagiarism and AI-generated text. Results did not support any significant differences in plagiarism. However, 6% of analyzed dissertations from 2023 were positive for AI-generated text (AI scores over 20%). This is significantly different from 2013 dissertations, which only had 0% or < 20% AI scores. The findings of this study suggest that some students may be relying on generative text or editing from AI in their dissertations. Dissertation committees and awarding institutions have an obligation to ensure the students’ educational and ethical development and promote academic integrity at every level of education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to provide personalized instruction for students and elevate administrative tasks for teachers. AI-driven tools can improve accessibility for students learning English as a second language (L2) or foreign language helping educators consider their use in teaching. This research study explores AI-enabled technology usage, challenges, and opportunities in the Arab World. Study data is gathered from semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face, qualitative interviews with English language instructors at the University of Ha’il, KSA and Ajman University, UAE. Theoretically supported by sociocultural theory, results provided strong insights into AI technology in teaching. Results revealed that key challenges included plagiarism and the impact on students’ skills development, highlighting concerns about academic integrity and overreliance on AI tools like ChatGPT. Despite AI's potential to improve learning experiences by offering personalized support, participants emphasize the need for balanced integration and ethical use. Effective implementation needs comprehensive training for educators and maintaining a balance between AI tools and traditional teaching approaches to preserve critical thinking and creativity while using AI’s advantages. Thus, considering the findings, this study concludes that AI should supplement traditional teaching methods, ensuring that it enhances rather than replaces the crucial human aspects of education. Finally, study recommendations and implications are discussed accordingly. © 2025 Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.

T2  - European Journal of Educational Research
AB  - The integration of AI tools in education is reshaping how students view and interact with their learning experiences. As AI usage continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to understand how students' perceptions of AI technology impact their academic performance and learning behaviours. To investigate these effects, we conducted a correlational study with a sample of 44 students to examine the relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT’s utility—focusing on usage frequency, perceived usefulness, accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency—and key academic outcomes, including content mastery, confidence in knowledge, and grade improvement. Additionally, we explored how these perceptions influence student behaviours, such as reliance on ChatGPT, procrastination tendencies, and the potential risk of plagiarism. The canonical correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT's utility and their academic outcomes. Students who viewed ChatGPT as reliable and efficient tended to report higher grades, improved understanding of the material, and greater confidence in their knowledge. Furthermore, the bivariate correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between dependency on ChatGPT and procrastination (r = 0.546, p < .001), indicating that a higher reliance on AI tools may contribute to increased procrastination. No statistically significant association was identified between ChatGPT dependency and the risk of plagiarism. Future research should prioritize the development of strategies that promote the effective use of AI while minimizing the risk of over-reliance. Such efforts can enhance academic integrity and support independent learning. Educators play a critical role in this process by guiding students to balance the advantages of AI with the cultivation of critical thinking skills and adherence to ethical academic practices. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Some transformative potential lies within the integration of artificial intelligence into higher education: enhanced efficiency and innovation, together with problems of a high degree of complexity. This abstract draws on issues such as job displacement, inequality, privacy concerns, bias, over-reliance on technology, and ethical dilemmas. It shows why careful consideration, ethical frameworks, and responsible implementation will be required to optimize benefits but reduce risks. The article draws on a multidimensional theoretical framework to analyze these implications through the review of existing literature and secondary data. In this respect, accountability mechanisms are required to make AI systems fair and ethical in decision-making. Strong protection for privacy with very strict measures of data security is essential. Continuing dialogue with the stakeholders and promotion of digital literacy are of paramount importance in safeguarding ethical practices toward its holistic implementation. It may also mean setting at the front line such issues as ethical guidelines, educational equity, and digital citizenship in the AI integration process to ensure its effective navigation with the empowerment of students through it in the digital era. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - Some serious instances of plagiarism have been discussed in Bangladesh's institutions, where students, researchers, and even faculty members were given severe penalties. This study explores the factors influencing teachers of English at the tertiary level in Bangladesh regarding plagiarism, including emerging concerns around AI-based plagiarism. A mixed-method research design has been used to answer two research questions: (1) What are the perceptions of English teachers about plagiarism at the tertiary level? and (2) What are the factors that influence these perceptions? Data were collected through a survey questionnaire administered to 128 English teachers from 25 public and private universities in Bangladesh, followed by in-depth interviews with 10 teachers involved in research supervision. Factor analysis revealed institutional negligence, lack of writing courses, absence of plagiarism policies, and infrequent use of plagiarism detection software as major drivers of plagiarism. The thematic analysis identified concerns relating to the misuse of AI tools that escalate plagiarism and make its detection difficult. Respondents expressed the need for guidelines with respect to the ethical application of AI in academic writing. Recommendations include making writing courses mandatory, including plagiarism policies in course outline, and implementing AI-specific plagiarism detection tools to strengthen the academic integrity of higher education. © 2025 European Knowledge Development (EUROKD).

AB  - In recent years, the adoption of AI technologies in academia has increased, prompting a need to explain factors driving scholars to adopt or plan to adopt AI technologies in research routines. This study integrates three models into one integrated model: TAM, UTAUT, and SCT. These three models are combined to understand how GenAI self-efficacy, perceived ethics, academic integrity, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risks, ease of use, and perceived usefulness influenced the participants’ intention to adopt GenAI in research. Following this, data were collected from Egyptian academics linked to Egyptian universities. There were 742 responses to this question. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The paper's results showed that GenAI self-efficacy, social influence, and perceived ethics are significantly related to perceptions of ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use GenAI. Facilitating conditions have a negative effect on perceived ease of use, and perceived risk does not affect perceived usefulness or intention to use significantly. Notably, the result found that ethics and academic integrity affect perceptions of GenAI's usage and utility. This guide illustrates how universities must take proactive steps to influence how AI will be used and reinforces the importance of using these tools within an ethical lens. This paper emphasizes the need to balance the use of generative AI and ethical practices. It examines the role of ethics and academic integrity in perceptions that influence attitudes toward the use of generative AI. They represent a step forward in our understanding of how to induce AI adoption–in this case, in the academic context, and specifically in Egypt. Additionally, it places sound emphasis on the role of AI technology and how it can be beneficial whilst advocating for a sensible approach in that application, which includes ethical principles. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - World Journal of English Language
AB  - The widespread use of internet-based media and AI-powered tools for learning has provided students with convenient access to information and writing assistance. However, rather than improving their English academic writing skills, such reliance may lead to academic misconduct, including plagiarism and unethical use of AI-generated content. Such concerns motivate the researchers to gain insights from 50 second-semester students in Indonesia enrolled in two English essay writing courses regarding academic integrity and violations. Employing a qualitative descriptive approach, data were collected through a questionnaire assessing students’ understanding of academic integrity, followed by an analysis of 94 essays from 47 students before and after completing the questionnaire. Findings revealed a notable gap between students’ conceptual understanding of academic integrity and their actual writing practices. Although students recognized the importance of ethical writing, instances of plagiarism from internet sources and AI-generated text incorporation persisted. These discrepancies stem from underdeveloped English writing proficiency, lack of awareness about plagiarism, and dependency on digital assistance. The study underscores the need for early and continuous instruction in academic integrity and English writing skills, along with institutional policies and support systems to mitigate academic misconduct in English academic writing. © 2025 Sciedu Press.

AB  - This study examines the multifaceted dimensions of artificial intelligence literacy among library and information science students across South Asia, focusing on socio-demographic variables such as country, level of study, gender identity and English-language competency. A survey of 914 participants from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan highlights notable disparities in artificial intelligence literacy levels, with Indian students excelling in conceptual understanding and ethical awareness, Bangladeshi students demonstrating practical artificial intelligence proficiency and Pakistani students showing heightened sensitivity to ethical concerns. The findings reveal that advanced levels of study correlate with greater artificial intelligence literacy, while language competency influences familiarity and understanding but not overall proficiency. While artificial intelligence tools are widely used for academic tasks like information searching, proofreading and article summarization, limited exposure to advanced applications and pervasive ethical concerns – such as academic integrity and plagiarism – underscore the need for targeted interventions in library and information science education. This research contributes to the global discourse on artificial intelligence literacy by providing empirical evidence to inform curriculum development, policymaking and professional readiness. It advocates for inclusive, ethical and regionally tailored artificial intelligence literacy programmes to prepare library and information science students for the demands of artificial-intelligence-driven library and information management services, enriching both local and international library and information science education frameworks. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Australasian Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - There is a growing need to upskill higher education (HE) teachers for the effective and responsible integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their classrooms. This case study sought to address this growing need by designing and delivering a training course for educators, focusing on the use of ChatGPT as it was the most commonly used tool at the time. The professional development opportunity lasted 5 weeks and covered critical aspects of GenAI use for teaching and learning. Data collected from participants included discussion board entries, written tasks and focus groups. Findings highlight some of the common practices and concerns HE practitioners had regarding the use of GenAI in their practice. The findings also emphasise the importance of providing teachers with customised GenAI training to facilitate its effective integration in HE contexts. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose the TPTP Support System for Teachers, built upon four key areas: teacher training, pedagogical support, testing revamp and practice networks. This system aims to guide institutional efforts to facilitate and support educators as they integrate GenAI in HE. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence models into academic settings has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Given that researchers' interactions with and perceptions of these technologies can substantially influence academic procedures and outputs, identifying the key determinants of their incorporation into university environments is crucial. This investigation pursued two main objectives: first, to identify the variables that condition the implementation of AI models in research activities, and second, to analyze how perceived ethical considerations and academic integrity influence their adoption. The empirical study was conducted through a digital survey administered to 302 academic researchers from Peruvian public and private universities. The analytical methodology employed structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, grounded in an expanded version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model. The results demonstrated that six out of nine hypotheses were supported; social influence, educational self-efficacy, and academic integrity were identified as primary factors predicting researchers' use of AI models. Effort expectancy had a significant negative effect on AI model use. Furthermore, the use of AI models was found to significantly influence both teachers' concerns and perceived ethics among academics. Notably, performance expectancy, technological self-efficacy, and personal anxiety did not significantly affect AI model use. This study contributes to the understanding of AI adoption in academic research by highlighting the importance of social, educational, and ethical factors. These findings have implications for developing policies and training programs to promote responsible AI use in higher education and suggest a need to reevaluate traditional technology acceptance models in the context of AI in academia. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Academic integrity is a cornerstone of education systems, yet the rise of contract cheating poses significant challenges for higher education institutions. Current approaches to managing contract cheating often lack the comprehensive structure needed to address the complexities of modern cheating methods. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed Three-Tier Framework (TTF), designed in our previous study to combat contract cheating. The proposed framework comprises three tiers: awareness, monitoring, and evaluation. It engages stakeholders within the system and encourages a proactive and collaborative stance against contract cheating while reinforcing a culture of academic honesty. The evaluation focuses on three key aspects: the clarity of the framework’s functions and objectives, the potential challenges in implementing the proposed monitoring process, and the perceived limitations in detecting and mitigating contract cheating through this framework. Supervised and unsupervised assignments are considered, excluding the option of e-proctoring, as some students encountered difficulties setting up necessary tools and software for online exams. Survey results reveal a broad consensus among respondents, who expressed strong confidence in the clarity and effectiveness of the framework and its monitoring procedures. These positive perceptions were consistent across respondents, regardless of their prior experience or familiarity with contract cheating. Although the overall feedback was positive, concerns were raised regarding implementing the framework in current educational settings. Specific challenges cited include tight timelines and the increased workload associated with the new procedures, emphasising a need for additional guidance, training, and institutional support to ensure effective adoption. The proposed framework incorporates an instructor dashboard designed to streamline academic workflow and simplify the monitoring process introduced in this framework. The survey results confirm that the framework can be adopted to address the unique needs of academics and diverse educational environments; however further research is needed to explore its applicability across the broader higher education community. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Providing timely and personalized feedback on open-ended student responses is a challenge in education due to the increased workloads and time constraints educators face. While existing research has explored how learning analytic approaches can support feedback provision, previous studies have not sufficiently investigated educators' perspectives of how these strategies affect the assessment process. This paper reports on the findings of a study that aimed to evaluate the impact of an AI-driven platform designed to assist educators in the assessment and feedback process. Leveraging Large Language Models and learning analytics, the platform supports educators by offering tag-based recommendations and AI-generated feedback to enhance the quality and efficiency of open-response evaluations. A controlled experiment involving 65 higher education instructors assessed the platform's effectiveness in real-world environments. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, this study investigated the platform's usefulness and relevance from the instructors' perspectives. Moreover, we collected data from the platform's usage to identify partners in instructors' behavior for different scenarios. Results indicate that AI-driven feedback significantly improved instructors' ability to provide detailed, personalized feedback in less time. This study contributes to the growing research on AI applications in educational assessment and highlights key considerations for adopting AI-driven tools in instructional settings. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

TI  - Artificial intelligence as a collaborative tool for script development
AU  - Cake, S.
T2  - Media Practice and Education
AB  - In early 2023, as the release of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT became more widespread, concerns arose in the higher education sector regarding how students might use generative AI (gen-AI), not only for writing critical essays, but for producing creative works. Multiple gen-AI tools appeared specifically targeting the application to writing screenplays. This prompted the question: what are the ethical and pedagogical implications of integrating gen-AI within the context of teaching and learning screenwriting within the academy? The research design for this project applied a practice-based approach to script development, embedding critical reflection on the iterative process of engaging with gen-AI to write a short screenplay. The gen-AI was also prompted to self-critique the story it generated. The research identified ethical concerns regarding equitable access to technology, the potential for bias and theft of works used to train the AI. The study also found that engaging with gen-AI privileged analytical thinking over emotional engagement with the creative process. The findings suggest that creative confidence and an awareness of one’s own creative process are critical to effectively engage with gen-AI. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly embedded in daily life. In the field of education in particular, concerns have emerged about how these tools might positively or negatively impact student learning. In the current study, I conduct a randomized field experiment exploring how policies on genAI impact undergraduate students’ beliefs, behaviors, and grades. Students enrolled in two sections of the same upper-level undergraduate research methods course were randomly assigned to a section that either permitted or prohibited genAI tools. At the end of the semester, students enrolled in the section permitting genAI tools had a more positive view of genAI in higher education. However, students enrolled in the section prohibiting these tools had a higher final grade. These results highlight the need for evidence-based guidelines on how to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits of genAI in higher education. © 2025 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - Generative AI (hereinafter GenAI) technology, such as ChatGPT, is already influencing the higher education sector. In this work, we focused on the impact of GenAI on the academic integrity of assessments within higher education institutions, as GenAI can be used to circumvent assessment approaches within the sector, compromising their quality. The purpose of our research was threefold: first, to determine the extent to which the use of GenAI can be detected via the marking and moderation process; second, to understand whether the presence of GenAI affects the marking process; and finally, to establish whether authentic assessments can safeguard academic integrity. We used a series of experiments in the context of two UK-based universities to examine these issues. Our findings indicate that markers, in general, are not able to distinguish assessments that have had GenAI input from assessments that did not, even though the presence of GenAI affects the way markers approach the marking process. Our findings also suggest that the level of authenticity in an assessment has no impact on the ability to safeguard against or detect GenAI usage in assessment creation. In conclusion, we suggest that current approaches to assessments in higher education are susceptible to GenAI manipulation and that the higher education sector cannot rely on authentic assessments alone to control the impact of GenAI on academic integrity. Thus, we recommend giving more critical attention to assessment design and placing more emphasis on assessments that rely on social experiential learning and are performative rather than output-based and asynchronously written. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic GenAI has enabled students to complete higher education assessments quickly and with good quality, leading to challenges in academic integrity. GenAI has transformed the requirements and considerations in assessment design in higher education. Authentic assessments are seen as a prominent way to tackle the GenAI challenge. What this paper adds We provide quantitative and qualitative experimental evidence suggesting that GenAI can generate authentic assessments that pass the scrutiny of experienced academics. We demonstrate how the use of authentic assessments alone does not protect the academic integrity of students in higher education. Our qualitative analysis indicates that markers may generate false positive and false negative results if they suspect GenAI tampering in an assessment. Thus, students' learning is not assessed correctly. Implications for practice and/or policy When universities and national organisations design policies regarding GenAI, authentic assessments are not the panacea; the focus must remain on assessment design. Assessments of learning need to shift from assessing output to focusing on process and relevance to the workplace. That would mean a paradigmatic shift from written assessments to synchronous interpersonal assessments. The move away from written assessments has implications that are far reaching for the academy if written assessments cannot be trusted as a reliable indicator for and of learning. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Recent studies have conceptualized ChatGPT as an epistemic authority; however, no research has yet examined how epistemic beliefs and metacognitive accuracy affect students' actual use of ChatGPT-generated content, which often contains factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the present experimental study aimed to examine how university students integrate correct and incorrect information from expert-written and ChatGPT-generated articles when writing independently (N = 49) or with ChatGPT assistance (N = 49). Students working with ChatGPT-4o integrated more correct information from both expert-written (d = 0.64) and ChatGPT-generated articles (d = 0.95), but ChatGPT-assisted writing did not affect the amount of incorrect information sourced from the ChatGPT-generated article. Regardless of the condition, hierarchical regressions revealed that lower metacognitive bias was moderately associated with increased inclusion of correct information from the expert-written article (R2 = 12%). Conversely, a higher metacognitive bias (R2 = 10%) and epistemic beliefs (R2 = 12%) were moderately related to the inclusion of incorrect information from ChatGPT-generated articles. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT assistance enhances the integration of correct human- and AI-generated content, metacognitive skills remain essential to mitigate the risks of incorporating incorrect AI-generated information. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly regarded as epistemic authorities due to their authoritative tone and human-like interaction. ChatGPT has demonstrated utility in providing correct information and improving productivity in educational and professional contexts, but it is also prone to inaccuracies, hallucinations and misleading content. Students' epistemic beliefs and metacognitive skills predict their ability to critically evaluate and integrate conflicting information from multiple resources, particularly when searching for information on the Internet. What this paper adds This study experimentally examines how students integrate correct and incorrect information from expert-written and ChatGPT-generated articles when writing independently or with ChatGPT's assistance. The findings show that ChatGPT assistance improves the inclusion of correct information but does not significantly reduce or increase the inclusion of incorrect ChatGPT-generated content. Metacognitive accuracy and epistemic beliefs are key factors in mitigating the inclusion of incorrect information, regardless of whether students work independently or with ChatGPT. Implications for practice and/or policy Generative AI tools can outperform human experts in specific scenarios, requiring little to no evaluation. However, in situations where these tools generate misleading or incorrect content, the application of metacognitive skills and epistemic beliefs becomes essential to discern reliable information and avoid the integration of errors. Educational interventions should include activities requiring justification of knowledge, evaluation of resources and reflection upon human-generated and AI-generated texts to enhance students' ability to discern accurate from inaccurate information. Interventions focused on metacognitive accuracy and epistemic awareness can empower individuals to critically evaluate and differentiate between reliable and erroneous information, enhancing their recognition of misinformation. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.

T2  - Information Research
AB  - Introduction. Generative AI presents opportunities and challenges for higher education, particularly concerning equity. Understanding stakeholders' perceptions of equity is crucial as AI increasingly influences teaching, learning, and administrative practices. Method. The study was conducted in a large, research-intensive institution in the US. Participants (n=206) from diverse university roles responded to an open-ended question about how Generative AI affects educational equity. The responses were analyzed based on the information and equity dimensions (Lievrouw & Farb, 2003). Analysis. Data were analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive coding to identify key themes. The framework of information inequity underscores how disparities in access, skills, and ethical considerations create uneven opportunities for stakeholders to benefit from Generative AI, making these dimensions essential for understanding educational equity. Results. Findings revealed differing focal points among the groups: faculty and staff concentrated on issues of physical and financial access to AI tools, while students placed greater emphasis on the ethical implications and value-based considerations of AI in education. Conclusion. The study suggests that addressing AI equity in higher education requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond improving access. AI literacy education should include skills development and address ethical considerations, ensuring that all stakeholders' concerns are met. © 2025, University of Boras. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the risks affecting digital transformation in higher education institutions in Kazakhstan through a multi-method research approach. The investigation integrates quantitative surveys (N=4,971 students), qualitative focus groups (N=100 faculty and administrators), and expert evaluations using PEST analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of transformation challenges. Key findings revealed that scientific and technical factors emerged as the most significant risk drivers (x? = 8.25), followed by economic constraints (x? = 7.62) and organizational readiness barriers (x?= 6.71). Survey results indicated that while 64.4% of students perceived digital technologies as beneficial for learning, 47.8% reported difficulties with digital platform usage. Focus group interviews highlighted critical challenges in three domains: infrastructure limitations (cited by 68% of faculty), pedagogical adaptation needs (noted by 72%), and ethical implications of AI integration (expressed by 85%). The PEST analysis identified technological factors as primary risk drivers, with rapid platform adoption and data security concerns ranked highest. The study advances a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating both internal and external risks in digital transformation, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions, organizational development strategies, and enhanced institutional readiness measures. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and institutional leaders implementing digital transformation initiatives in emerging educational contexts. © 2025 Fırtına Akademi A.Ş.

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, presents new challenges impacting student perceptions of academic integrity. While extensive research exists on academic misconduct and student perceptions of various infractions, there is limited understanding of how AI tools impact these views and whether their use constitutes a violation of academic integrity policies. This study explores university students’ awareness and perceptions of academic misconduct, particularly concerning AI tool usage. A survey of domestic and international students enrolled at major universities in the United States received 277 valid responses. The results reveal high awareness of university integrity policies and significant concern about the use of AI for writing papers, with substantial variance in perceptions of misconduct severity. Notably, using AI to write entire papers is seen as major misconduct by a majority, while smaller AI-assisted tasks are viewed as less severe. Regression analysis highlights the importance of ethical education, revealing that students who view AI writing as cheating and those who believe cheating is unethical perceive academic misconduct more seriously. Conversely, student demographics (major, educational level, gender, international status), awareness of AI detection tools, and perceived ethics of AI use show complex, often non-significant relationships with perceptions of misconduct severity. These findings provide indication that education and clear policy about AI usage and academic misconduct could be useful in addressing a growing number of infractions in the face of emerging AI trends. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - The rapid expansion of generative artificial intelligence tools for textual production, such as ChatGPT, has been accompanied by a proliferation of similar tools used for creating images, audiovisual content, and motion graphics. These tools, valued for their creativity, are increasingly employed in the fields of art, education, and entertainment to enhance content creation, particularly on social media, while also reducing production costs. However, their use is not without controversy, as they raise significant ethical concerns, including the potential for generating fake news and disinformation. This paper presents an analysis of higher education students’ perspectives on the use of generative artificial intelligence tools within the context of a university course. The research was conducted through semi-structured interviews with 10 fourth-year students from the Department of Communication and Digital Media at the University of Western Macedonia. The study aims to provide an initial understanding of the impact of these tools in both education and communication, focusing on students who are future professionals in the communication field. The interviews explored the potential benefits of these technologies, which were valued highly, and the challenges presented such as privacy and credibility issues, which concerned the participants. Misinformation and deception were cited as the most significant risks, while these tools were evaluated positively in terms of communicative purposes, but still maintaining skepticism. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - This qualitative study explores lecturers’ perspectives on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in personalised learning within higher education. The rapid proliferation of AI has introduced numerous ethical challenges, including the potential for academic dishonesty and misuse. One concern highlighted in this study is maintaining academic integrity while fostering responsible and ethical AI use in educational contexts. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, the research examines how lecturers navigate these complexities through innovative teaching and assessment strategies. Data were collected from 16 lecturers via open-ended questionnaires, and thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke’s six-step framework, was employed to identify recurring themes. The study is limited in its reliance on self-reported data, which may not fully capture the nuances of lecturers’ experiences or practices. Additionally, the study is context-specific, focusing on a limited sample size, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader contexts. Findings reveal that lecturers employ strategies such as using AI-detection tools like Turnitin to uphold academic integrity, redesigning assessments to include in-class components, and encouraging transparency by having students declare AI use. Another significant finding is the emphasis on fostering critical thinking skills to enable students to engage ethically with AI tools. The study recommends that higher education institutions train lecturers and students on ethical AI use, promote transparency in AI-assisted academic work, and invest in technologies that support these objectives. Revising assessment strategies to incorporate innovative, controlled formats is also suggested to mitigate misuse, ensuring the responsible integration of AI into educational practices. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The use of AI technology in education has generated an increasing interest in teachers, academicians, researchers, and students. This study synthesizes the responses from a survey conducted among 2230 students at a technical university in Czechia, aiming to capture their attitudes towards integrating AI technology in academic settings. We analyzed students’ perceptions on familiarity with the topic, perceived benefits and challenges of AI in education, ethical aspects, and perspectives for their teachers on this technology. A questionnaire was designed and administered within the frame of this study. Results reveal that the majority of respondents are familiar with and use AI technology, most of whom use it ‘sometimes’ or ‘commonly.’ Information processing and understanding is the most common purpose for using AI. Time efficiency and accessibility are the most reported advantages of AI, while the potential disadvantages involve credibility, overreliance, misuse, and scope-level concerns. Half of participants suggest students rarely or never consider ethical issues in their AI use. Most students believe that universities should clarify the gray areas regarding how and in which areas AI is allowed by establishing relevant ethical guidelines. Nearly half of student participants report that their teachers are moderately or more open to improving their understanding of AI use, while only a minority report that their teachers use it in practice. © 2024 by the authors of this.

AB  - In this study, the researchers explore lecturers’ perspectives on the impact artificial intelligence (AI) has on blended learning within the context of South African higher education. AI is transforming traditional teaching and learning by enabling academic institutions to offer computerised, effective, and objective educational processes. The research was conducted to address the growing need to understand lecturers’ viewpoints on how AI can enhance educational practices and overcome existing challenges in blended learning environments. To investigate this phenomenon, the researchers applied the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) model as theoretical framework for the study. Their qualitative research undertaking employed a singular case study design focusing on 15 lecturers from the College of Education at a selected academic institution, to arrive at an in-depth understanding of lecturers’ experiences and perceptions of how AI is integrated in blended learning. The researchers examined both the benefits and challenges associated with a blended teaching and learning mode, in the context of AI integration. The data collection process involved semi-structured focus group interviews that allowed for in-depth discussions to be conducted. This was complemented by detailed document analysis to analyse the course materials and teaching methods used by the lecturers. Homogeneous, purposeful sampling was applied to select participating lecturers who shared specific characteristics relevant to the study. Data analysis involved coding through the induction method, which helped to reveal relevant codes that were subsequently categorised. The study also included a comprehensive literature review of recent research findings, which were correlated with the collected data. The findings underscored the critical need for supportive measures, such as management backing, enhanced training opportunities, professional development initiatives, reliable technological infrastructure, improved internet connectivity, and additional time allocation, for the successful implementation of blended learning which integrates AI. This study contributes valuable insights into, and discussions on, the implications of adopting AI in a hybrid learning environment. © The Author(s) 2024.

TI  - Diverging perceptions of artificial intelligence in higher education: A comparison of student and public assessments on risks and damages of academic performance prediction in Germany
AU  - Lünich, M.
AU  - Keller, B.
AU  - Marcinkowski, F.
T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into higher education, particularly through Academic Performance Prediction (APP), promises enhanced educational outcomes. However, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding data privacy, potential biases, and broader socio-technical implications. Our study, focusing on Germany–a pivotal player in shaping the European Union's AI policies–seeks to understand prevailing perceptions of APP among students and the general public. Initial findings of a large standardized online survey suggest a divergence in perceptions: While students, in comparison to the general population, do not attribute a higher risk to APP in a general risk assessment, they do perceive higher societal and, in particular, individual damages from APP. Factors influencing these damage perceptions include trust in AI and personal experiences with discrimination. Students further emphasize the importance of preserving their autonomy by placing high value on self-determined data sharing and explaining their individual APP. Recognizing these varied perceptions is crucial for educators, policy-makers, and higher education institutions as they navigate the intricate ethical landscape of AI in education. This understanding can inform strategies that accommodate both the potential benefits and concerns associated with AI-driven educational tools. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - This study investigates how U.S. college students (N = 1001) perceive and use ChatGPT, exploring its relationship with societal structures and student characteristics. Regression results show that gender, age, major, institution type, and institutional policy significantly influenced ChatGPT use for general, writing, and programming tasks. Students in their 30s–40s were more likely to use ChatGPT frequently than younger students. Non-native English speakers were more likely than native speakers to use ChatGPT frequently for writing, suggesting its potential as a support tool for language learners. Institutional policies allowing ChatGPT use predicted higher use of ChatGPT. Thematic analysis and natural language processing of open-ended responses revealed varied attitudes towards ChatGPT, with some fearing institutional punishment for using ChatGPT and others confident in their appropriate use of ChatGPT. Computer science majors expressed concerns about job displacement due to the advent of generative AI. Higher-income students generally viewed ChatGPT more positively than their lower-income counterparts. Our research underscores how technology can both empower and marginalize within educational settings; we advocate for equitable integration of AI in academic environments for diverse students. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Most higher education institutions employ study advisors to support their students. To adequately perform their task, study advisors have access to study information about their students. Using AI techniques to analyze that information and to predict if a student might be at risk of study delay could be a valuable tool in study advisors' practice. In this paper, we present a use case of how such a tool was developed (in the form of a dashboard) and which steps and considerations played a role in the responsible deployment of the tool. Three aspects are described: first, we present the timeline of the case study and zoom in on how the macro-level of the institution (where the groundwork is laid to facilitate AI-systems in education) and the micro-level of the implementation of the system influenced each other. Second, we describe which stakeholders were involved and what their ethical considerations were concerning data management, algorithms, and pedagogy. Third, we describe the initial evaluation of the dashboard in terms of study advisors’ experiences and provide suggestions on how to stimulate the responsible and useful implementation of a predictive modelling tool. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Applied Corpus Linguistics
AB  - The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) poses new challenges for L2 writing teachers. This study investigates the distinguishability of essays written by Japanese EFL learners from those generated by ChatGPT. Partially replicating Herbold et al. (2023), 140 first-year university students wrote essays and completed a survey on ChatGPT use. Among them, 125 wrote independently, 13 used ChatGPT for proofreading, and two asked ChatGPT to write the entire essay. To create a comparative dataset, 123 additional essays were generated by ChatGPT, imitating the two texts. The resulting 263 essays were then analyzed using the natural language processing (NLP) technique, including automated linguistic analysis and machine learning classification using random forest. The results reveal significant differences between human-written and ChatGPT-generated essays across all linguistic features, with the latter being easily identifiable. This study emphasizes the need for clear guidelines on the ethical use of AI in L2 writing, highlighting the potential risk of inappropriate AI use and the importance of fostering a mutual understanding of AI use with learners regarding responsible AI integration in academic work. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The emergence of artificial intelligence, exemplified by generative chatbots such as ChatGPT, has elicited optimism among some educators regarding enhanced teaching and learning methods. Simultaneously, it has raised concerns among others, who perceive these chatbots as being disruptive to established pedagogical norms developed over centuries. This study investigated pre-service teachers’ perceptions regarding integrating ChatGPT into physical sciences teaching at a rural South African university. A case study research design utilizing a qualitative approach was adopted to collect, analyze, and interpret data. This methodology was employed to gain comprehensive insight into the viewpoints held by final year Bachelor of Education Honors physical sciences students serving as pre-service teachers. The study explored the benefits and potential challenges of incorporating emerging technologies such as ChatGPT into physical sciences teaching. The theoretical framework guiding the study was the technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. Eleven purposively sampled physical sciences pre-service teachers participated in semi-structured interviews. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The research findings indicate that ChatGPT has the potential to contribute to the teaching of physical sciences in the areas of lesson planning, preparation, presentation, and formative assessment. However, the study revealed that ChatGPT is unable to answer certain questions in the physical sciences accurately and this was of great concern. These findings shed light on how artificial intelligence generative chatbots can be incorporated into physical sciences learning. The findings provide insights for policymakers, who can facilitate the use of these tools in lesson preparation; science educators, who should leverage the chatbots to enhance learner engagement; and researchers, to help them deepen their understanding of the role of emerging technologies in science education. ©Authors.

AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students' inevitable use of AI chatbots. This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - This systematic literature review (SLR) study explores artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool to address academics challenges in South African higher education. Numerous difficulties beset higher education system in South Africa, such as a lack of funding, high student-to-lecturer ratios, and unequal access to high-quality education. Relevant academic databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, ERIC, and Web of Science, was searched using a combination of keywords relating to South African higher education, AI in education, academic issues, and AI technologies. A total of twenty (20) documents were identified and used in this study. The examination looks at how AI is currently being used, how it affects how people teach and learn, and the opportunities and challenges that come with using it in this setting. The results show that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including automated assessment tools, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive learning platforms, have the potential to improve personalized learning experiences, boost student engagement and academic performance, and facilitate effective management of educational resources. However, overcoming several issues, such as a lack of technological know-how, restricted infrastructure, concerns about equity, and ethical implications is necessary for the successful integration of AI in South African higher education. It encourages educators, politicians, and technology experts to work together to establish long-term solutions for incorporating AI into teaching and learning processes while maintaining inclusivity, equity and ethical issues. ©Authors.

AB  - The growing use of generative AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) calls the sustainability of traditional assessment practices into question. Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate eloquent essays on any topic and in any language, write code in various programming languages, and ace most standardized tests, all within seconds. We conducted an international survey of educators and students in higher education to understand and compare their perspectives on the impact of generative AI across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Across three universities, 680 students and 87 educators, who moderately use generative AI, consider essay and coding assessments to be most impacted. Educators strongly prefer assessments that are adapted to assume the use of AI and encourage critical thinking, while students' reactions are mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, alongside higher-order thinking and authentic applications. © 2024 The Author(s)

Methods: We implemented a literature-validated questionnaire to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the target population during the period between April and August 2023. Themes of ethical debate included privacy breaches, consent, ownership, augmented biases, epistemology, and accountability. Participants’ responses were showcased using descriptive statistics and compared between groups using t-test or ANOVA. Results: We included 466 participants. The greater majority of respondents were interns and residents (50.2%), followed by medical students (38.0%). Most participants were affiliated with university institutions (62.4%). In terms of privacy, participants acknowledged that Big Data and AI were susceptible to privacy breaches (39.3%); however, 59.0% found such breaches justifiable under certain conditions. For ethical debacles involving informed consent, 41.6% and 44.6% were aware that obtaining informed consent posed an ethical limitation in Big Data and AI applications and denounced the concept of “broad consent”, respectively. In terms of ownership, 49.6% acknowledged that data cannot be owned yet accepted that institutions could hold a quasi-control of such data (59.0%). Less than 50% of participants were aware of Big Data and AI’s abilities to augment or create new biases in healthcare. Furthermore, participants agreed that researchers, institutions, and legislative bodies were responsible for ensuring the ethical implementation of Big Data and AI. Finally, while demonstrating limited experience with using such technology, participants generally had positive views of the role of Big Data and AI in complementing healthcare. Conclusion: Jordanian medical students, physicians in training and senior practitioners have limited awareness of the ethical risks associated with Big Data and AI. Institutions are responsible for raising awareness, especially with the upsurge of such technology. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In response to China's ‘smart campus’ trend, facial recognition technology (FRT) in higher education has evolved from identification to emotion recognition, raising various risks and controversies. Understanding college students’ perceptions is key to addressing these concerns and facilitating AI integration. This study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to gauge students’ attitudes towards FRT, introducing three new constructs: ‘personal innovativeness,’ ‘trust in the system,’ and ‘perceived risks.’ Results show that students’ personal innovativeness and trust in the system positively relate to their acceptance intention. Trust in FRT is hindered by perceived privacy, psychological, and performance risks, while perceived social risks are insignificant. Higher education shows less resistance to FRT due to normalized campus surveillance. Compared to Western societies, Chinese students’ Confucian cultural stance of ‘harmony but not uniformity’ reduces concerns about racial or religious discrimination from FRT. These findings are crucial for assessing FRT's necessity and legality in higher education and devising risk mitigation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The widespread popularity of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots has sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly regarding their impact on academic integrity among students. While several studies have examined AI's role in education, a significant gap remains concerning how AI chatbot usage affects students’ perceptions of academic integrity. This study aims to address this gap through rigorous quantitative techniques to explore the dynamics of student interactions with AI chatbots and assess whether this engagement diminishes academic integrity in higher education. Using a non-experimental design, the research investigates the causal relationship between AI chatbot usage and academic integrity, focusing on eight latent variables identified in the literature. A stratified sampling technique was employed to collect a representative sample of 594 participants via a 5-point Likert scale survey from four Southern Asian countries. The dataset underwent extensive statistical analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. The findings establish significant links between motivations for using AI chatbots and a decline in academic integrity. The study identifies a behavioral link between academic integrity and pedagogical limitations, highlighting traditional classroom-based pedagogy as the most impactful factor influencing students’ motivation to engage with AI chatbots. This research not only quantitatively addresses ethical concerns related to AI in academia but also offers insights into user behavior by assigning distinct weights to post-usage behavioral factors, differentiating it from earlier studies that treated these factors equally. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The rapid adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT by students has the potential to disrupt the higher education sector, with concerns being raised by academics about potential threats to academic integrity. This paper contributes to the pressing discussion about responses to AI tools by examining students' perceptions and the use of generative AI to assist them with assessments. Based on a survey among 337 Australian university students, this study found that more than a third of students have used a chatbot for assistance with an assessment, and do not necessarily perceive this as a breach of academic integrity. The study further investigated to what extent different psychosocial factors such as learning motivations, distress or resilience are associated with students’ use of AI chatbots in order to ascertain environmental conditions or risk factors driving their use. Findings suggest that the higher education sector faces the challenge of not only defining clear policies and guidelines about ethical and academically honest ways to use and integrate generative AI tools into university education and assessments, but also to rethink the design of assessment pieces. © 2024

AU  - Herrmann, L.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The use of computational tools to predict academic success has become increasingly popular. Machine learning algorithms, trained on past study histories, have been shown to provide valid predictions. However, knowing about biases and unfairness in algorithms, one should take a closer look at these predictions. This paper explores the extent to which the predictive accuracy of academic success varies between specific groups of students, focusing on traditional and non-traditional students (NTS), who have not acquired a higher education entrance qualification at school. In a case study the study compares several popular algorithms and their prediction quality, and investigates whether misclassified NTS show positive or negative biases. Results revealed that the accuracy of predicting academic success for NTS was significantly lower than when considering all students as a whole. The direction of the distortion cannot be determined exactly due to small case numbers. The study emphasizes that the possibility of bias always has to be considered when predicting study success, and the use of such tools must ensure there are no undesirable biases that could affect certain students. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Researchers have observed the relationship between educational achievements and students' demographic characteristics in physical classroom-based learning. In the context of online education, recent studies were conducted to explore the leading factors of successful online courses. These studies also investigated how demographic features impact student achievement in the online learning environment. This motivates the use of demographic information alongside other features to predict students' academic performance. Since demographic features include protected attributes, such as gender and age, evaluating predictive models must go beyond minimizing the overall error. In this work, we analyze and investigate the use of neural networks to predict underperforming students in online courses. However, our goal is not only to enhance the accuracy but also to evaluate the fairness of the predictive models, a problem concerning the application of machine learning in education. This paper starts by analyzing the available solutions to fairness in predictive models: bias mitigation with pre-processing and in-processing methods. We show that the current evaluation is missing the case of partial awareness of protected features, which is the case when the model is aware of bias on some protected attributes but not all. The in-processing method, specifically the adversarial bias mitigation, shows that debiasing in some protected features exacerbates the bias on other protected features. This observation motivates our proposal of an alternative approach to enhance bias mitigation even in the partial awareness scenario by working with latent space. We implement the proposed solution using denoising autoencoders. The quantitative analysis used three distributions from The Open University Learning Analytics dataset (OULAD). The obtained results show that the latent space-based method offers the best solution as it maintains accuracy while mitigating the bias of the prediction models. These results indicate that in the case of partial awareness, the latent space method is considered superior to the adversarial bias mitigation approach. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - ChatGPT's impact on education is both significant and inevitable, presenting a paradox of threats and benefits. While studies have explored ChatGPT's usage, intention, and motivation, few have addressed its paradoxical use from a benefit-risk-coping perspective, leaving gaps in practical and theoretical solutions. This study integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to elucidate ChatGPT's paradoxical use in education. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it aims to provide insights and solutions for managing the benefits, risks, and coping mechanisms associated with ChatGPT in education. Hypotheses and propositions were tested on Taiwanese higher education users (N = 351). Findings from SEM confirm that the perceived threat of ChatGPT's severity decreases the intention to use it, while coping strategies such as self-efficacy and response efficacy strongly predict the intention to use ChatGPT. Additionally, the benefits of performance expectancy and task efficiency significantly increase the intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn significantly increases actual usage behavior. Findings from fsQCA reveal three configurations for both the usage and disusage of ChatGPT in education. The study identifies three constructs with necessary conditions. This research makes a significant theoretical contribution by integrating UTAUT and PMT into a unified framework to elucidate the paradoxical aspects of benefit-risk-coping in the use of ChatGPT. Practical implications for higher educational institutions and their scholars (e.g., students, lecturers, researchers) are also provided through confirmed solutions from the QCA model. These solutions offer strategic insights to leverage the benefits, identify the risks, and cope with the threats associated with using ChatGPT in education. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, notably ChatGPT, are increasingly recognised for their transformative potential in higher education. This study employs a detailed case study approach complemented by a survey, delving into ChatGPT’s impact on pedagogical practices, student engagement, and academic performance. It involved 74 undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in data analytics courses in Australia. The quantitative analysis highlights ChatGPT’s role in providing personalised and on-demand support, which is highly valued among users for its flexibility and responsiveness, meeting a critical demand in educational settings. Notably, the study identifies a medium effect size (η2=0.173) in perceived benefits, indicating that ChatGPT accounts for approximately 17.3% of the variance in improved academic outcomes. However, challenges such as ChatGPT’s limited understanding of complex queries and the lack of human interactions are primary concerns, with a medium effect size (η2=0.289) suggesting significant areas for improvement. Furthermore, statistical analyses reveal a clear relationship between the frequency of ChatGPT usage and the perception of its benefits, underscoring the transformative potential for users who have integrated it into their academic practices. Despite these challenges, the differential impact on users versus non-users highlights the potential for ChatGPT to foster more engaging and effective educational practices. The findings advocate for targeted strategies to epitomise ChatGPT’s integration into educational settings, emphasising the need for ongoing research and the development of comprehensive guidelines to navigate its complexities and maximise its educational benefits. © The Author(s) 2024.

TI  - AI and ethics: Investigating the first policy responses of higher education institutions to the challenge of generative AI
AU  - Dabis, A.

T2  - Humanities and Social Sciences Communications
AB  - This article addresses the ethical challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in higher education and explores the first responses of universities to these challenges globally. Drawing on five key international documents from the UN, EU, and OECD, the study used content analysis to identify key ethical dimensions related to the use of generative AI in academia, such as accountability, human oversight, transparency, or inclusiveness. Empirical evidence was compiled from 30 leading universities ranked among the top 500 in the Shanghai Ranking list from May to July 2023, covering those institutions that already had publicly available responses to these dimensions in the form of policy documents or guidelines. The paper identifies the central ethical imperative that student assignments must reflect individual knowledge acquired during their education, with human individuals retaining moral and legal responsibility for AI-related wrongdoings. This top-down requirement aligns with a bottom-up approach, allowing instructors flexibility in determining how they utilize generative AI especially large language models in their own courses. Regarding human oversight, the typical response identified by the study involves a blend of preventive measures (e.g., course assessment modifications) and soft, dialogue-based sanctioning procedures. The challenge of transparency induced the good practice of clear communication of AI use in course syllabi in the first university responses examined by this study. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - This research investigates bias in AI algorithms used for monitoring student progress, specifically focusing on bias related to age, disability, and gender. The study is motivated by incidents such as the UK A-level grading controversy, which demonstrated the real-world implications of biased algorithms. Using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, the research evaluates fairness with metrics like ABROCA, Average Odds Difference, and Equality of Opportunity Difference. The analysis is structured into three experiments. The first experiment examines fairness as an attribute of the data sources and reveals that institutional data is the primary contributor to model discrimination, followed by Virtual Learning Environment data, while assessment data is the least biased. In the second experiment, the research introduces the Optimal Time Index, which pinpoints Day 60 of an average 255-day course as the optimal time for predicting student outcomes, balancing timely interventions, model accuracy, and efficient resource allocation. The third experiment implements bias mitigation strategies throughout the model's life cycle, achieving fairness without compromising accuracy. Finally, this study introduces the Student Progress Card, designed to provide actionable personalized feedback for each student. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - MedieKultur
AB  - The sudden and meteoric rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) has raised fundamental concerns for universities. Using Bacchi’s methodology on ‘problematisation’, we analyse which concerns Danish universities have addressed through their policies and guidelines. We identify three key problematisations: assessment integrity, legality of data and veracity. While each of these problematisations involves specific limitations, together they also strongly emphasise symbolic and epistemological issues and consequently mostly ignore the materiality of genAI, for example, in terms of labour and energy use. Drawing on critical AI studies, this article argues that universities should also consider the huge planetary costs that (gen)AI poses as well as the full range of AI’s exploitative business models and practices. Universities should integrate these considerations into both their decision-making on (not) using certain technologies and their policies and guidelines for research and teaching, just as sustainability is already a criterion in their travel or investment policies today. © 2024 Society of Media Researchers In Denmark.

AB  - The increasing use of AI-assisted writing tools in education presents new challenges in ensuring the integrity and originality of student essays. This study investigates English teachers’ perceptions of various essay assessment methods in light of these challenges. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative Likert-scale data and qualitative open-ended responses, the research reflects the perspectives of 50 experienced educators from the Faculty of Linguistics at the National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.” The study investigates teachers' familiarity with AI tools, the challenges they face in assessing AI-assisted student work, and their views on AI's role in aiding or potentially hindering student writing skills. Findings indicate that while many educators support AI for tasks like grammar and proofreading, concerns persist over its impact on students' critical thinking and originality. Assessment methods currently in use include in-class handwritten essays, oral defenses, AI-detection software, and portfolios. The results indicate that hybrid assessment methods are rated as the most effective for evaluating AI-influenced essays, indicating a preference for combining traditional and AI-specific techniques. Implications and recommendations for research and practice have been outlined, emphasizing a balanced approach that promotes ethical AI usage, critical thinking, and academic integrity in writing assessments. © 2024, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.

T2  - Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching and Learning
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on students' learning experiences and perceptions through a master’s-level course. The study specifically focused on student engagement, comfort with GenAI and ethical considerations. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an action research methodology employing qualitative data collection methods, including pre- and post-course surveys, reflective assignments, class discussions and a questionnaire. The AI-Ideas, Connections, Extensions (ICE) Framework, combining the ICE Model and AI paradigms, is used to assess students' cognitive engagement with GenAI. Findings: The study revealed that incorporating GenAI in a master’s-level instructional design course increased students' comfort with GenAI and their understanding of its ethical implications. The AI-ICE Framework demonstrated most students were at the initial engagement level, with growing awareness of GenAI’s limitations and ethical issues. Course reflections highlighted themes of improved teaching strategies, personal growth and the practical challenges of integrating GenAI responsibly. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size poses challenges to the analytical power of the findings, potentially limiting the breadth and applicability of conclusions. This constraint may affect the generalizability of the results, as the participants may not fully represent the broader population of interest. The researchers are mindful of these limitations and suggest caution in interpreting the findings, acknowledging that they may offer more exploratory insights than definitive conclusions. Future research endeavors should aim to recruit a larger cohort to validate and expand upon the initial observations, ensuring a more robust understanding. Originality/value: The study is original in its integration of GenAI into a master's-level instructional design course, assessing both the practical and ethical implications of its use in education. By utilizing the AI-ICE Framework to evaluate students' cognitive engagement and employing action research methodology, the study provides insights into how GenAI influences learning experiences and perceptions. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and the real-world application of GenAI, offering actionable strategies for its responsible use in educational settings. © 2024, Dwayne Wood and Scott H.

TI  - Are AI detection and plagiarism similarity scores worthwhile in the age of ChatGPT and other Generative AI?
AU  - Baron, P.
T2  - SOTL in the South
AB  - Recent advancements in chatbots have provided students and academics with a new mode of how knowledge can be sourced and composed. Within a very short space of time, students and academics have flocked to use ChatGPT and other Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) platforms owing to their capable responses. Additionally, apart from the generative chatbots (such as ChatGPT and Gemini), AI writing tools for paraphrasing, summarising, and co-writing have also become capable and increasingly prevalent to such a degree that the public is spoilt for choice. Having conducted tests on popular chatbots and AI writing tools, it became clear that while programs like Turnitin are developing new algorithms to detect plagiarism and AI-generated content, the initial findings from this study suggest that this may be an increasingly difficult task. These tests were published on YouTube, and within a few weeks, the evidence garnered tens of thousands of views as students and educators seemed uncertain about the strengths, weaknesses, and legalities of these AI tools. What is clear is that we have passed the tipping point, and AI assistance is no longer just a grammar fixer. The implications of this are concerning and far-reaching, as plagiarism is already a significant problem in universities. This position paper reports on tests conducted using Turnitin software and AI writing tools such as ChatGPT and QuillBot. These real-world tests support the paper’s position that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes original work in a world of GAI. The aim of this article is to provide evidence that educators who rely on similarity checking and AI detectors in their current form may inadvertently be supporting plagiarism rather than reducing it. A new method of academic plagiarism detection is proposed, utilizing large language models to generate and track ideas, thereby serving as an idea database. The proposed method focuses on the "understanding" of the work rather than on text similarity. © 2024 University of Johannesburg. All rights reserved.

T2  - Social Sciences
AB  - In this paper, the effects of the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) in higher education (HE) are discussed. A mixed exploratory research approach was employed to understand these impacts, combining analysis of current research trends and students’ perceptions of the effects of Gen AI tools in academia. Through bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review, 64 publications (indexed in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases) were examined, highlighting Gen AI’s disruptive effect on the pedagogical aspects of HE. The impacts identified by the literature were compared with the perceptions held by computer science students of two different HE institutions (HEIs) on the topic. An exploratory study was developed based on the application of a questionnaire to a group of 112 students. The results suggest that while Gen AI can enhance academic work and learning feedback, it requires appropriate pedagogical support to foster critical, ethical, and digital literacy competencies. Students demonstrate awareness of both the risks and benefits associated with Gen AI in academic settings. The research concludes that failing to recognize and effectively use Gen AI in HE impedes educational progress and the adequate preparation of citizens and workers to think and act in an AI-mediated world. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Collegiate Aviation Review
AB  - Despite the potential opportunities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chatbots in higher education, ethical concerns surrounding their use, such as biased data assumptions and plagiarism, have been raised. Despite studies examining these concerns in higher education, there seems to be a gap in evaluating perceptions of constructs: ethical use, attitudes towards technology, behavioral factors, and student learning outcomes relating to Generative AI Chatbots in Collegiate Aviation Programs in the U.S. Using perceptions of aviation students from six universities in the U.S. (n=271), a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of the constructs fit the empirical data well; most hypothesized relationships were significantly supported. The most substantial direct relationship was between attitude towards AI Chatbot use and behavioral intention to use AI Chatbots. Despite deep concerns about the ethical use of AI Chatbots in collegiate aviation programs, the model could explain about 59% of the variances in user behavior, suggesting relatively good user behavior among respondents. Graduate respondents had higher user behavior than first—and second-year undergraduates, who had higher scores on ethical use concerns. Male respondents showed higher user behavior than female respondents. By understanding students’ perceptions, administrators can create well-informed policy guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective integration of AI Chatbot tools in collegiate aviation programs pedagogy. © 2024, University Aviation Association.

AB  - The research aims to assess the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of the teaching and learning of journalistic writing techniques in the university educational context. The main objective consists of analysing the abilities of AI to solve the composition of different journalistic texts¸ both informative and opinion, and the quality of the result, as well as other applications of AI in journalistic writing. The text tries to contribute to the knowledge on the use of AI by teachers and students in the teaching and learning process. A mixed methodology has been used to develop the research: on the one hand, descriptive and comparative, based on surveys to university professors in Spain specialised in this subject and to students taking related contents in their studies, also in this context; on the other hand, an experimental research is included among professors trained in the field of Journalistic Writing, who are asked for the qualified correction of an exam, anonymous, actually carried out with the AI system, ChatGPT. After weighing the results, each of them is interviewed in depth about the quality of the texts, their strengths, and weaknesses. The results show that AI is beginning to be used in the university context by students and professors. In the specific field of journalistic writing, its use for the moment is limited to assisting tasks in the writing process or suggesting topics, while the automatic generation of content is not widely accepted due to the ethical implications that it entails, especially those related to the originality of content. Teachers value the potential of this technology for writing simple and informative pieces but observe limitations at deeper levels of knowledge and in hybrid texts. © 2024 Communication & Society.

T2  - IAFOR Journal of Education
AB  - In the context of education, the issues of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching and maintaining academic integrity in students’ use of AI are particularly relevant. This paper empirically examined the issue of ChatGPT usage for writing homework from the perspectives of students and professors. Study research methods included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In Study 1, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 350 Croatian students, users of ChatGPT, to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, habits, and intentions regarding ChatGPT usage for homework assignments. In Study 2, twelve faculty members were tested on their accuracy of distinguishing between original students’ papers and ChatGPT-generated papers. For this purpose, 25 different versions of papers for 8 different courses were prepared. The results of the students’ survey showed that most students still do not use ChatGPT regularly and have neutral attitudes about its usefulness, ease of use, risks, and intentions for future use. In addition, they were moderately concerned about ethical issues around its usage. Differences across gender and field of study were found. Professors, on the other hand, reported having average self-efficacy in appraising authorship, which is in line with their low average accuracy of 53%. Accuracy in distinguishing was lowest when ChatGPT was instructed to write a paper as a student. These results strongly suggest the necessity for clear guidelines, plagiarism detection tools, and educational initiatives to promote ethical use of AI technology. © 2024, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - In a context where artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education, this study analyzes how students’ perceptions of AI influence their academic integrity (INA), with a focus on sustainable education. Through a correlational-explanatory analysis based on Structural Equation Models (SEMs) applied to a sample of 659 students from 13 universities in Chile and Peru, it is observed that AI has a significant and direct impact on academic integrity in both countries (β = 0.44). In Peru, the most influential dimension is trust in education (λ = 0.86), followed by social, economic, security, and risk implications (λ = 0.78), while attitudes towards AI also have a direct impact on integrity factors (β = 0.15). In Chile, the dimensions of trust in education (λ = 0.83) and social and economic impact (λ = 0.79) are most relevant, and the relationships between the dimensions of academic integrity such as justice, respect, and responsibility (λ = 0.71) are stronger. The study highlights the importance of incorporating AI literacy into educational curricula and developing regulatory frameworks that promote its ethical use, linking these actions to sustainable education. The findings highlight the need for sustainable educational approaches that enhance understanding of AI and ensure that its use in academia is beneficial, ethical, and contributes to sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly significant in education, the lack of teacher readiness continues to hinder its effective use in language teaching in Kazakhstan. This study aims to address this gap by exploring EFL teachers’ experiences with AI integration and assessing their ethical competences. Using a mixed-methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data from survey and semi-structured interviews (further coded, and thematically analyzed) were collected from 60 English language teachers from different universities in Kazakhstan. The results indicated that language teachers were least confident in ethical use of AI in language teachings. The findings revealed the finalized six main ethical competences and 24 sub-competences, including (i) AI literacy competence, (ii) pedagogical and technical competence, (iii) assessment and reflection competence, (iv) facilitation of student autonomy competence, (v) professional and legal ethics competence, and (vi) responsibility and accountability competence. These competences offer a framework for developing future EFL teaching and learning programs that maximize AI’s benefits while addressing potential ethical challenges. © 2024, Qubahan.

AB  - As generative AI (GenAI) policies in higher education in Thailand have been introduced, inquiries regarding GenAI integration and adoption in teaching and learning have been raised. Delving into a relatively unexplored interdisciplinary area in this context, this study aimed to investigate students' responses towards the use of GenAI in academic and professional public relations (PR) writing, employing the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) frameworks. This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured focus group sessions among native Thai PR major university students, with a workshop on GenAI prior to the discussion on its adoption. The findings revealed that all participants were aware of GenAI and most had utilized it for daily and academic purposes, but never in professional PR writing. Despite having positive attitudes towards its use after the trial, they recognized certain drawbacks and concerns and expressed some reservations towards adopting GenAI in their future academic and professional PR writing, rather in English than in Thai. Besides knowledge and perceptions, individual characteristics were also attributed to hindering GenAI adoption among some participants. Therefore, providing adequate resources and practical guidelines on appropriate GenAI use are crucial. Future research in other subject areas and languages is suggested. © 2024 Language Institute, Thammasat University. All rights reserved.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has brought profound changes to higher education. While many studies have examined the potential use of ChatGPT in teaching and learning, few have explored the opportunities to develop assessments that facilitate the use of multiple technological innovations (i.e. traditional AI and GenAI tools). We conducted qualitative research to address this gap. The assessments of an elective English course in Hong Kong were re-designed to incorporate GenAI and other tools. Students were asked to employ and reflect on their use of these tools for their writing assessments. We analyzed the written reflections of 74 students and conducted focus group interviews with 28 students. The results suggest that the students possess an acumen for choosing the appropriate online tools for specific purposes. When they can choose freely, they develop skills that allow them to evaluate and select between traditional AI and GenAI tools when appropriate. Some students mentioned concerns with the different features of the free and premium versions. The results of this study call for (1) assessment practices that allow the flexibility to use different AI tools and (2) the equitable use of various AI tools. © 2024

AB  - The potential application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in schools and universities poses great challenges, especially for the assessment of students’ texts. Previous research has shown that people generally have difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that novice (N = 89) and experienced teachers (N = 200) could not identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written texts. However, there are some indications that more experienced teachers made more differentiated and more accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed source on quality assessment were heterogeneous. Our findings demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which poses a challenge to schools and universities in grading student essays. Our study provides empirical evidence for the current debate regarding exam strategies in schools and universities in light of the latest technological developments. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In recent months, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had, and will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Journal of Academic Librarianship
AB  - This article addresses three key questions related to the ethical facets of algorithmic literacy. First, it synthesizes existing literature to identify six core ethical components, including bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, accuracy, and non-maleficence. Second, a crosswalk maps the intersections of these principles across the Association of College and Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and Joint Statement on Principles for Responsible Algorithmic Systems. This analysis reveals significant overlap on issues like unfairness and transparency, helping prioritize topics for instruction. Finally, case studies showcase pedagogical strategies for teaching ethical considerations, informed by the crosswalk. Workshops for diverse undergraduates and computer science students employed reallife instances of algorithmic bias to prompt reflection on unintended harm, contestability, and responsible development. Pre-post surveys indicated expanded critical perspectives after the interventions. By systematically examining shared values and testing instructional approaches, this study provides practical tools to shape ethical thinking on algorithms. It also demonstrates promising practices for responsibly advancing algorithmic literacy across disciplines. Ultimately, fostering interdisciplinary awareness and multipronged educational initiatives can empower students to question algorithmic authority and biases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - In our postdigital world, unseen algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) underpin most business and educational technologies and systems. Also, the use of educational data to better understand and support teaching and learning is growing in higher education. Other AI technologies such as synthetic media and AI-generated avatars are increasingly used to present video-based content in business and society but are less common in educational content and lectures, as their effectiveness and impact on learning are still being researched and debated. In this study, an AI-generated avatar was implemented in the redesign of business ethics material in a postgraduate course to present videos and online activities and to prompt critical reflection and discussion of the social and ethical implications of algorithms. Using a qualitative research design, we then explored students’ perceptions of teaching and learning with AI-generated avatars. The students interviewed felt AI avatars were suitable, sometimes even preferred, for lecture delivery, with some enhancements. This study contributes insights into the use of AI-generated avatars in education by examining their potential benefits and challenges and generating three key pedagogical principles to consider. Future directions for educational design and research are discussed, particularly the pressing need to engage students creatively and critically with the social and ethical implications of AI avatars. © The Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Exploring the implementation of artificial intelligence applications among academic libraries in Taiwan
AU  - Huang, Y.-H.
T2  - Library Hi Tech
AB  - Purpose: This study explored the different artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in academic libraries and the key factors and impediments related to their implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The author applied quantitative research methods in the form of a questionnaire, using both open and closed questions. A total of 472 valid questionnaires were received from academic librarians. Findings: The author sought responses from librarians who had implemented AI applications and those who had not, identifying the types of AI applications implemented, key factors relating to their implementation, and impediments to promoting AI. Gaps were identified between the level of support for AI applications and the negative effect of the impediments. Furthermore, the more extensive the individual and organizational knowledge activities performed by the librarians and libraries held, the more positive the attitude was librarians' attitude toward AI applications in their libraries. However, librarians recognized that AI applications are inevitable, but indicated that the difficulties of in execution have hampered the adoption of AI. Research limitations/implications: The sample data were collected in Taiwan; therefore, the data may only represent the views of Taiwanese academic librarians on AI applications. The results of this study may not apply to librarians worldwide; however, they may provide a useful reference. Practical implications: The results revealed the top four AI applications that libraries would most likely implement in the near future. Therefore, AI application developers and suppliers can prioritize the promotion of these products for to academic libraries. This study revealed that funding and costs related to AI implementation were discovered to be key factors relating to implementing AI applications. Some impediments to the implementation of AI applications relate to technological problems. Several librarians suggested that managers should invest more resources at an early stage rather than reducing cutting back on human resources initially. Although worries regarding privacy and ethics were mentioned expressed by some respondents, most academic librarians did not regard these to be major concerns. Originality/value: This study provides the perspectives of librarians who have implemented AI applications and of those who have not. In addition, it explores the advantages and disadvantages of AI applications, and the level of support for and impact of AI applications and promotions. This study also included a gap analysis. Moreover, individual and organizational knowledge activity scales were adopted to examine AI awareness and the perceptions of academic librarians. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study investigates the relationship between the perceived benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and risks of generative AI (GenAI) tools and the fundamental factors of the TPB model (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control). The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students’ intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - This study explores the impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on critical thinking and collaboration among university students, highlighting the importance of investigating these technologies due to their increasing integration into higher education and their potential to transform traditional pedagogical practices. A predominantly female sample was surveyed to assess their familiarity with and experience and perceptions of these tools. A total of 87% of the respondents had prior knowledge of generative AI tools, with 38% using them occasionally. Among the most popular tools are Canva 2024 (33%), Chat PDF (26%), and YOU.COM (24%). Additionally, 64% of the respondents believe that these tools significantly improve their critical thinking ability. Despite their high familiarity with and occasional use of these tools, the need for continuous training and technical support was identified. While generative AI tools show promising potential for enhancing collaboration and critical thinking in higher education, previous research has limitations, such as the lack of longitudinal data and the inadequacy in addressing ethical considerations and potential biases. More comprehensive research is needed to understand their long-term impact better and maximize their potential benefits. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - Higher education is currently under a significant transformation due to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, the hype surrounding GenAI and the increasing influence of educational technology business groups over tertiary education. This commentary, prepared for the Special Issue of the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice (JUTLP) on “Enhancing student engagement using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chatbots,” delves into the complex landscape of opportunities and threats that AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, introduce to the realm of higher education. We argue that while GenAI offers promise in enhancing pedagogy, research, administration, and student support, concerns around academic integrity, labour displacement, embedded biases, environmental sustainability, increased commercialisation, and regulatory gaps necessitate a critical approach. Our commentary advocates for the development of critical AI literacy among educators and students, emphasising the necessity to foster an environment of responsible innovation and informed use of AI. We posit that the successful integration of AI in higher education must be grounded in the principles of ethics, equity, and the prioritisation of educational aims and human values. By offering a critical and nuanced exploration of these issues, our commentary aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how higher education institutions can navigate the rise of GenAI, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all stakeholders while upholding core academic values. © by the authors.

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - Feedback, particularly the formative or ‘feed-forward’ type is important for students in higher education to understand their errors and improve their expression and clarity of ideas. While technology-assisted feedback modes, e.g., audio or video are prevalent, ensuring their efficacy and succinctness, particularly for non-English-speaking background (NESB) educators can be challenging. This study investigates the attitudes and experiences of NESB educators in the School of Engineering of RMIT University, with a focus on their use of AI-assisted tools for providing feedback to students in higher education settings. Utilising a survey, the researchers examined how personal and linguistic attributes influenced feedback strategies and explored the educators' perspectives on integrating AI tools, such as ChatGPT and BARD, in their teaching practice and to enhance student engagement with the feedback they received. Through thematic analysis the findings reveal that personal background and linguistic proficiency significantly influenced the provision of feedback. Furthermore, even though educators had different levels of familiarity with AI-assisted tools, there was a general consensus on the potential utility of these tools for improving feedback provision. These will require targeted staff training, careful human oversight to ensure quality and avoid bias, and customised AI training to align feedback with individual teaching styles. © by the authors,.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive assessment of GenAI tools towards assessment and pedagogic practice and, subsequently, discuss the potential impacts. This study experimented using three assessment instruments from data science, data analytics, and construction management disciplines. Our findings are two-fold: first, the findings revealed that GenAI tools exhibit subject knowledge, problem-solving, analytical, critical thinking, and presentation skills and thus can limit learning when used unethically. Secondly, the design of the assessment of certain disciplines revealed the limitations of the GenAI tools. Based on our findings, we made recommendations on how AI tools can be utilised for teaching and learning in HE. © 2024.

AB  - Background: Geriatric comanagement has been shown to improve outcomes of older surgical inpatients. Furthermore, the choice of discharge location, that is, continuity of care, can have a fundamental impact on convalescence. These challenges and demands have led to the SURGE-Ahead project that aims to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for geriatric comanagement in surgical clinics including a decision support for the best continuity of care option, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Objective: This qualitative study aims to explore the current challenges and demands in surgical geriatric patient care. Based on these challenges, the study explores the attitude of interviewees toward the introduction of an AI-supported CDSS (AI-CDSS) in geriatric patient care in surgery, focusing on technical and general wishes about an AI-CDSS, as well as ethical considerations. Methods: In this study, 15 personal interviews with physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and social workers, employed in surgical departments at a university hospital in Southern Germany, were conducted in April 2022. Interviews were conducted in person, transcribed, and coded by 2 researchers (AU, LB) using content and thematic analysis. During the analysis, quotes were sorted into the main categories of geriatric patient care, use of an AI-CDSS, and ethical considerations by 2 authors (AU, LB). The main themes of the interviews were subsequently described in a narrative synthesis, citing key quotes. Results: In total, 399 quotes were extracted and categorized from the interviews. Most quotes could be assigned to the primary code challenges in geriatric patient care (111 quotes), with the most frequent subcode being medical challenges (45 quotes). More quotes were assigned to the primary code chances of an AI-CDSS (37 quotes), with its most frequent subcode being holistic patient overview (16 quotes), then to the primary code limits of an AI-CDSS (26 quotes). Regarding the primary code technical wishes (37 quotes), most quotes could be assigned to the subcode intuitive usability (15 quotes), followed by mobile availability and easy access (11 quotes). Regarding the main category ethical aspects of an AI-CDSS, most quotes could be assigned to the subcode critical position toward trust in an AI-CDSS (9 quotes), followed by the subcodes respecting the patient’s will and individual situation (8 quotes) and responsibility remaining in the hands of humans (7 quotes). Conclusions: Support regarding medical geriatric challenges and responsible handling of AI-based recommendations, as well as necessity for a holistic approach focused on usability, were the most important topics of health care professionals in surgery regarding development of an AI-CDSS for geriatric care. These findings, together with the wish to preserve the patient-caregiver relationship, will help set the focus for the ongoing development of AI-supported CDSS. © Adriane Uihlein, Lisa Beissel, Anna Hanane Ajlani, Marcin Orzechowski, Christoph Leinert, Thomas Derya Kocar, Carlos Pankratz, Konrad Schuetze, Florian Gebhard, Florian Steger, Marina Liselotte Fotteler, Michael Denkinger.

AB  - The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has led to the creation of ChatGPT. Despite its potential benefits, the effects of ChatGPT on higher education accessibility and inclusion are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of ChatGPT on the accessibility and inclusivity in higher education for students. We delivered five questions to identify the applicability of ChatGPT, including the utilization of ChatGPT in higher education, the benefits of ChatGPT in higher education, the perception of quality answered by ChatGPT, user-friendliness interface of ChatGPT, and ChatGPT on enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. These focus questions were purposefully created to strategise the integration of ChatGPT within the higher education framework. Total of 85 respondents, comprising undergradu-ate students from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Nigeria participated in this study. It was found that a significant 75.6% of respondents feel ChatGPT has enhanced higher education accessibility and inclusivity. This highlights the potential of AI technologies to improve educational environment by increasing accessibility and levelling the learning ecosystem for students with various requirements and back-grounds. There was still a widespread distinction of knowledge and viewpoints among students. Although some students consider ChatGPT to be just marginally useful and are only slightly satisfied with its quality, others express high satisfaction.

AB  - Technostress is a phenomenon in which rapid technological advancement affects teachers’ psychological well-being. It is an emerging concern in English language education, which may be exacerbated by the advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT. This study explores the factors that influence technostress among English language teachers using GenAI tools and strategies that can alleviate it. Based on the analysis of qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 16 instructors at higher education institutions in Hong Kong, the study identifies the rapid advancement of AI technology, inadequate training and lack of experience as contributors to technostress. It also names mitigating strategies including targeted professional development, online engagement and gradual integration. These techniques can foster Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and reduce the challenges of incorporating GenAI into English teaching. The findings align with existing literature on the impact of technostress and the role of TPACK. The practical implications include the need for comprehensive training, supportive communities and a balanced approach to AI integration. This investigation also expands the theoretical understanding of technostress in English language teaching and the use of GenAI tools, providing empirical support for existing frameworks. It also suggests directions for future research, which could investigate teacher well-being, effective AI integration and the impact of TPACK. © (2024), (Educational Technology and Society).

TI  - Ethical concerns for using artificial intelligence chatbots in research and publication: Evidences from Saudi Arabia
AU  - Sobaih, A.E.E.
T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational generative chatbots have drawn the attention of academics and have been increasingly used in the scientific research process since the inauguration of ChatGPT in November 2022. Despite growing research on AI chatbots’ usage in research and publication, limited studies have deeply addressed the ethical concerns that arise from their usage. This research explores the perceptions of academics and their leaders regarding the use of AI chatbots in research and publication. It addresses the ethical dilemma and ethical approaches considered by academics and their leaders for shaping their decisions for the use or non-use of chatbots in scientific research. For these purposes, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 academics/researchers and 11 leaders of scientific research in public universities in Saudi Arabia. The results of the thematic analysis confirmed that AI chatbots are extensively used in scientific research, albeit many researchers present their publications as their own work with no acknowledgement of the support from chatbots. The results showed ten interrelated ethical concerns, which would impact the growth of pseudoscience in developing countries if these concerns were not overcome. Hence, strategies for mitigating these ethical concerns are suggested. The research showed that academics often use chatbots based on a “utilitarian” approach, whereas most leaders consider the “virtue” or the “common good” approach for their concerns about chatbot adoption in scientific research. This research calls for policy and interventions from policymakers and other stakeholders about the responsible and ethical use of chatbots in research and publication. © 2024. Abu Elnasr E. Sobaih.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: This study examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, on higher education (HE). The ease with which content can be generated using GenAI has raised concerns across academia regarding its role in academic contexts, particularly regarding summative assessments. This research makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining university student and staff perceptions of current and future issues pertaining to the role of GenAI in universities. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method involving five one-to-one semi-structured interviews with four students and a lecturer explored the ethical and practical issues of GenAI text generation in academia. An inductive thematic analysis was chosen as it provided nuanced insights aligned with the study’s goals. Findings: Use of GenAI was discussed within the context of a range of topics, including perceptions of academic misconduct, authorial integrity and issues pertaining to university policies. Participants universally defined traditional classifications of academic misconduct but were unable to provide clear definitions where the use of GenAI was included for writing summative assessments. Students showed a more open engagement with GenAI, considering it a tool for overcoming obstacles rather than a means to plagiarise. Educators were generally more cautious and less optimistic about the academic role of GenAI. Lack of clear institutional policies surrounding such tools also contributed to ethical ambiguities. Originality/value: The study highlights diverging perspectives between students and academics, which necessitate a forum for dialogue, ensuring the need to develop clear policies to steer the integration of GenAI in a manner that is beneficial for students and academics. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

T2  - Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics
AB  - Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised higher education teaching and learning. AI has the power to analyse large amounts of data and make intelligent predictions thus changing the whole teaching and learning processes. However, such a rise has led to institutions questioning the morality of these applications. The changes have left librarians and educators worried about the major ethical questions surrounding privacy, equality of information, protection of intellectual property, cheating, misinformation and job security. Libraries have always been concerned about ethics and many go out of their way to make sure communities are educated about the ethical question. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has caught them unaware. Methods: This research investigates the preparedness of higher education librarians to support the ethical use of information within the higher and tertiary education fraternity. A qualitative approach was used for this study. Interviews were done with thirty purposively selected librarians and academics from universities in Zimbabwe. Results: Findings indicated that many university libraries in Zimbabwe are still at the adoption stage of artificial intelligence. It was also found that institutions and libraries are not yet prepared for AI use and are still crafting policies on the use of AI. Discussion: Libraries seem prepared to adopt AI. They are also prepared to offer training on how to protect intellectual property but have serious challenges in issues of transparency, data security, plagiarism detection and concerns about job losses. However, with no major ethical policies having been crafted on AI use, it becomes challenging for libraries to full adopt its usage. Copyright © 2025 Tsekea and Mandoga.

TI  - Leveraging AI Tools in University Writing Instruction: Enhancing Student Success While Upholding Academic Integrity
AU  - Akiba, D.
AU  - Garte, R.
T2  - Journal of Interactive Learning Research
AB  - The rise of AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini, presents both opportunities and challenges for higher education, particularly in writing instruction. This exploratory study examines a pedagogical approach that leverages LLM-generated feedback to engage students in detailed revision efforts, emphasizing the quality of iterative improvements over ungraded drafts. Students submitted drafts for AI feedback based on a rubric, revised their work, and were graded on the depth and quality of their revisions. Survey data from 39 undergraduate participants revealed that LLM feedback was clear, specific, and actionable, promoting deeper engagement with revisions and fostering independence. Students viewed this approach as ethical, aligning AI use with academic integrity while reducing the temptation to misuse AI for content creation. While some noted limitations, such as impersonal feedback, the overall reception was highly positive. By framing LLMs as tools for enhancement—or study partners, this study highlights their potential to support ethical, iterative learning and suggests promising directions for integrating AI into writing pedagogy in higher education. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

AB  - This paper explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) feedback into higher education. Specifically, it examines the views of 11 experienced instructors on fine-tuned GenAI formative feedback of student works in an online graduate program in the United States. The participants assessed sample GenAI reviews, and their perspec tives were recorded through numerical, best-adjective, and open-ended surveys. The findings revealed pervasively positive views across the AI feedback. Numerical survey results showed that the feedback was generally deemed relevant, clear, actionable, useful, and comprehensive. The best-adjective survey further specified the nature of these views. Openended responses supported both findings, suggesting that GenAI feedback aligned well with course rubrics and provided actionable suggestions. Nevertheless, some limitations were identified, such as redundancy and how lengthy suggestions could overwhelm students. The study offers suggestions for the improvement of fine-tuned GenAI feedback to improve its effectiveness and enhance higher education students’ learning experiences, especially in online settings. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Recent disruptions to higher education, including generative artificial intelligence, have highlighted an increased need for student support, particularly to enable a smooth transition in first-year university. The timing and the tone of support are critical. Here, content expert tutors were embedded in 24 first-year units to provide one-on-one draft assessment feedforward. Tutors received training on using the principle of the pedagogy of kindness; showing concern, compassion and empathy when interacting with students, and raising academic misconduct concerns. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of employing a pedagogy of kindness in tutor sessions on preventing academic integrity issues. Of the 704 draft assessments submitted, 51 students (7%) engaged in a discussion regarding academic integrity. Of these 51 students, 45 students passed their unit and only one required further investigation for academic misconduct. Tutors proactively contacted students who were identified as at risk of failing their unit. At-risk students who met with a tutor were more likely to pass their subject and achieved a higher average cumulative mark (51% vs 41%, p<0.05). In this paper, we evaluate how tutors providing a pedagogy of kindness increased meaningful learning and student success when incorporating cognitive presence. A responsive strategy using this pedagogical approach was implemented to address the increased use of generative artificial intelligence tools and to decrease the incidence of student academic misconduct. © 2024, Kaplan Singapore.

AB  - The widespread availability of generative-AI using Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided the means for students and others to easily cheat on written assignments - that is, students can use AI to generate text and then submit that work as their own. A variety of technical solutions have been developed to detect such cheating. However, concerns have been raised about the dangers of falsely identifying real students' responses as having been generated by AI. Here we evaluate a Generative AI detector that comes as an option with Turnitin, a widely used plagiarism-detection platform already in use at many universities. We compare 160 responses written by students in a class assignment with 160 responses generated by ChatGPT instructed to complete the same assignment. The ChatGPT responses were generated by 16 different prompts crafted to mimic those that plausibly might be given by individuals seeking to cheat on an assignment. The AI scores for the AI generated responses were significantly higher than the AI scores for the human-generated responses, which were all zero. Clearly, an arms race is set to develop between technology that facilitates cheating and technology that detects it. However, the present findings demonstrate that it is at least possible to deploy technical solutions in this context. Looking ahead, as various AI-methods become legitimate tools and are more seamlessly integrated into almost every aspect of daily life, it is unlikely that purely technical solutions will suffice. Instead, guidelines surrounding academic integrity will have to adapt to new conceptualizations of academic mastery and creative output. © 2024 Facultat de Psicologia, Ciencies de l'Educacio i de l'Esport Blanquerna.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate content such as texts, images, videos, sounds, etc. While GenAI tools have been utilized in various contexts, their utilization in the academic context is still a controversial topic. Scholars observed that many universities have banned GenAI due to the potential for unethical usage. In this opinion article, we promote the utilization of GenAI tools as feedback agents to alleviate challenges in conventional feedback provision. Feedback is a valuable learning source, especially in writing instructions. However, conventional feedback provision is challenging due to the increase in teacher’s workload and social irritation issues in peer feedback. Utilized ethically, GenAI tools can alleviate these challenges. A few critical considerations are briefly presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

T2  - Journal of Criminal Justice Education
AB  - Since the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar large language models in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become a significant societal force. Discourse about these developments through OpEds and blog posts have raised critical questions for educators about the promises and pitfalls of AI integration into higher education. Through an online survey administered to criminal justice educators (N = 68), the current study explores attitudes about and experiences with AI, and beliefs about the practical challenges AI presents. Results indicate criminal justice educators are both excited but also uncomfortable with the implications of AI for higher education. Respondents were generally concerned about the implications of AI for academic integrity and student development. Interestingly, respondents who had actually used AI tools expressed higher levels of excitement and comfort and lower levels of concern, suggesting that exposure to AI tools may play a key role in assuaging educators’ fears and concerns regarding AI tools. Additional findings and implications are discussed. © 2024 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence holds vast potential in academia, yet concerns arise regarding its usage. This study examines students’ perceptions and intentions to use ChatGPT through the signalling and elaboration likelihood model, which offers valuable insights into the transmission and procession of information. Two adoption approaches are considered: the peripheral route involves the utilization of simple cues requiring less cognitive effort, such as credibility, content quality, and critical mass, while the central route requires a person to critically evaluate the information rooted in perceived usefulness and technical advantages. Critical reasoning and digital efficacy are examined as moderating variables. Using convenience sampling, data from 694 respondents are collected via WeChat and www.wjx.cn in China. Structural Equation Modeling reveals a significant positive impact of perceived usefulness, technical advantages, credibility, content quality, and critical mass on student perceptions and intentions to use ChatGPT for academic performance. The findings inform policymakers and educators on AI tool integration in higher education, stressing the importance of understanding student perceptions and intentions. ChatGPT’s perceived benefits and challenges underscore its influence on student performance and educational practices. This study advocates for ethical guidelines and support systems to address AI integration concerns, emphasizing critical reasoning and digital proficiency as pivotal factors. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - GMS Journal for Medical Education
AB  - The high performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) in examination contexts has triggered an intense debate about their applications, effects and risks. What legal aspects need to be considered when using LLM in teaching and assessment? What possibilities do language models offer? Statutes and laws are used to assess the use of LLM: – University statutes, state higher education laws, licensing regulations for doctors – Copyright Act (UrhG) – General Data Protection Regulation (DGPR) – AI Regulation (EU AI Act) LLM and AI offer opportunities but require clear university frameworks. These should define legitimate uses and areas where use is prohibited. Cheating and plagiarism violate good scientific practice and copyright laws. Cheating is difficult to detect. Plagiarism by AI is possible. Users of the products are responsible. LLM are effective tools for generating exam questions. Nevertheless, careful review is necessary as even apparently high-quality products may contain errors. However, the risk of copyright infringement with AI-generated exam questions is low, as copyright law allows up to 15% of protected works to be used for teaching and exams. The grading of exam content is subject to higher education laws and regulations and the GDPR. Exclusively computer-based assessment without human review is not permitted. For high-risk applications in education, the EU's AI Regulation will apply in the future. When dealing with LLM in assessments, evaluation criteria for existing assessments can be adapted, as can assessment programmes, e.g. to reduce the motivation to cheat. LLM can also become the subject of the examination themselves. Teachers should undergo further training in AI and consider LLM as an addition. © 2024 März et al.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education. While universities have generally touted technological advancements as part of the fabric of their learning environments, the challenges to equitable outcomes for faculty and students related to the use of AI are under-recognized. There is scant work on the equity and morality of university AI policies and the implications for faculty within higher education institutions. While significant attention has been paid to the effect of tools like ChatGPT on student writing and academic integrity, less attention has been paid to how rapidly emerging AI policies affect other aspects of faculty work, and in potentially inequitable ways. This article considers AI policies at three large state universities to examine what policies are provided to faculty and their impacts, including instructional support for students, faculty research, and patents. Findings suggest that institutions vary greatly in terms of faculty guidance and far more work is needed to provide clear policies and resources regarding ethical AI for faculty. We discuss the implications, including challenges and opportunities for higher education institutions, and provide recommendations for moving forward as new technology continues to evolve. © 2024 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - The advent of Chat-GPT, an AI-driven technology, is reshaping various sectors, particularly higher education. This study, merging the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), explores the relationship between technology adoption and protection motivation in higher education, addressing the concept of “the (un)knowledgeable, the (un)skilled.” Through Structural Equation Modeling, findings from Indonesian participants (N = 445), including students and lecturers, reveal that perceived benefits such as task efficiency, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy predominantly motivate Chat-GPT use. Risk perception leans more on perceived vulnerability than severity, with insignificant impact from response cost. Response efficacy and self-efficacy significantly determine intention. Insight from moderating effect of educational level suggest that doctoral-level users demonstrate increased Chat-GPT usage, and gender plays a role in response efficacy and task efficiency. Both educational level and gender actively influence users’ intentions and actual usage behavior. These insights guide educators, policymakers, and institutions in ethically integrating AI, managing evolving risk perceptions, and empowering users in the dynamic AI landscape of higher education. Policymakers (e.g., university boards) are urged to dexterity an ethical framework and authorize in user efficacy to ensure equitable access and benefits from Chat-GPT in education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - More than a year has passed since reports of ChatGPT-3.5’s capability to pass exams sent shockwaves through education circles. These initial concerns led to a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary study to assess the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) against assessment tasks used across 10 engineering subjects, showcasing the capability of GenAI. Assessment types included online quiz, numerical, oral, visual, programming and writing (experimentation, project, reflection and critical thinking, and research). Twelve months later, the study was repeated using new and updated tools ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini, SciSpace and Wolfram. The updated study investigated the performance and capability differences, identifying the best tool for each assessment type. The findings show that increased performance and features can only heighten academic integrity concerns. While cheating concerns are central, opportunities to integrate GenAI to enhance teaching and learning are possible. While each GenAI tool had specific strengths and weaknesses, ChatGPT-4 was well-rounded. A GenAI Assessment Security and Opportunity Matrix is presented to provide the community practical guidance on managing assessment integrity risks and integration opportunities to enhance learning. © 2024 The Author(s).

T2  - International Journal of the Legal Profession
AB  - Assessing law students has always been a challenging task, but the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, compounds the problems already caused by increased student numbers, contract cheating and budget cuts in universities. As GenAI rapidly develops, legal educators must find ways to accommodate, and even incorporate, GenAI into their curricula and assessments so that law graduates can understand its capabilities and limitations within legal practice. Simultaneously, many jurisdictions, including Australia, have legislative obligations to deliver law graduates who satisfy legal knowledge-based “eligibility” requirements for admission into practice. This article introduces a knowledge framework for managing GenAI in legal education consisting of three pillars: Substantive Legal Knowledge, GenAI Ethics Knowledge, and GenAI System Knowledge. The authors argue this framework can assist legal educators in designing optimal assessments in an AI-disrupted world. The article employs the knowledge framework to examine the experiences and views of Australian law students’ engagement with GenAI outputs in completing a compulsory legal ethics assessment in 2023. This empirical case study demonstrates that effective assessment design incorporating GenAI can enhance law student and graduate outcomes despite the ongoing challenges for legal educators and the profession associated with GenAI. © 2024 The Author(s).

The online questionnaires were shared with undergraduate students at three Jordanian universities: Applied Science Private University, Jerash, and Petra via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Email, and LinkedIn. According to this research, the advantages of CHATGPT are saving time, getting immediate answers to various questions, writing for projects and homework, aiding in language learning, unified feedback, further learning material, and greater accessibility of information. Of course, there are disadvantages too: less critical thinking, only partial language capacity, incomplete knowledge of subjects, developing dependency on technology, misinformation, data privacy, and biased responses. The study concludes by recommending CHATGPT as a useful source of information, but its users must be sensitive to limitations and possible inaccuracies about the subject matter; fact-checking procedures must be done to establish whether the material is correct. Further, great care must be taken when using ChatGPT professionally to protect sensitive and secret information. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications). All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a potential solution to some of the biggest challenges in the field of education, but it can be a double-edged sword as it can also pose negative impacts to the learning process of students. This study aimed to determine the students’ level of awareness and extent of usage of AI tools. Cochrane’s formula was used to determine the sample size and the respondents were selected through random sampling technique. Data was collected from 193 educationstudents studying science and/or math through an online survey via Google Forms. Mixed-methods research design was employed in this study. A researcher-made survey questionnaire that underwent through reliability and validity tests was used to gather the needed quantitative data, followed by qualitative data acquisition through interviews. Results revealed that the students are slightly aware of the AI-powered learning tools and frequently use these technologies in accomplishing their schoolwork. The level of awareness is dependent on the gadgets that the students use. Moreover, the findings also showed that there is a direct relationship between the student’s level of awareness and extent of usage. Despite the possible negative impacts of AI on the students’ education, formulation of policies or guidelines on how the university can monitor the learners’ outputs to maintain quality education is recommended. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Detecting plagiarism, which is crucial for upholding institutional credibility, is a persistent and growing challenge for university faculty. The recent emergence of AI language models like ChatGPT introduces a new complication for faculty: discerning whether students have used AI in the production of their course work. Until AI detection software becomes effective at revealing the presence and the extent of the contributions made by AI to student submissions, the ability of faculty to detect, by either expertise or intuition, whether text is generated primarily by AI or student effort, is an important topic for exploration. We investigated faculty members' ability to differentiate paragraphs written by students from those generated by ChatGPT. One group of students used ChatGPT, while another wrote essays without AI assistance. We collected student essays and distributed random samples to 27 faculty members of an English department, 19 of whom responded to a questionnaire in which they reported their beliefs about which texts were written by students and which texts written by AI, and indicated the reasons underlying those beliefs. Faculty were generally successful in identifying ChatGPT-generated content using their expertise and intuition. Linguistic cues, such as syntactic structures, language idiosyncrasies, and contextual coherence gaps were commonly cited as explanations for their decisions. © 2024, Editorial Board English Scholarship Beyond Borders.

AB  - ChatGPT, a chatbot based on a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, can be used as a teaching tool in the educational setting, providing text in an interactive way. However, concerns point out risks and disadvantages, as possible incorrect or irrelevant answers, privacy concerns, and copyright issues. This study aims to categorize the strategies used by undergraduate students completing a source-based writing task (SBW, i.e., written production based on texts previously read) with the help of ChatGPT and their relation to the quality and content of students’ written products. ChatGPT can be educationally useful in SBW tasks, which require the synthesis of information from a text in response to a prompt. SBW requires mastering writing conventions and an accurate understanding of source material. We collected 27 non-expert users of ChatGPT and writers (Mage = 20.37; SD = 2.17). We administered a sociodemographic questionnaire, an academic writing motivation scale, and a measure of perceived prior knowledge. Participants were given a source-based writing task with access to ChatGPT as external aid. They performed a retrospective think-aloud interview on ChatGPT use. Data showed limited use of ChatGPT due to limited expertise and ethical concerns. The level of integration of conflicting information showed to not be associated with the interaction with ChatGPT. However, the use of ChatGPT showed a negative association with the amount of literal source-text information that students include in their written product. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Journal of Asian Public Policy
AB  - Considering the opportunities and challenges raised by generative AI (GenAI) technologies, many universities have been developing policies to guide the integration of GenAI in their academic community. Focusing on Asian universities, this paper presents a scoping review of policy development regarding the GenAI integration. Guided by the theoretical framework of technology integration, this study examined the GenAI policies of 30 universities from the QS top 60 Asian universities with inductive content analysis. The review reveals that these policies prioritized text generation applications, student management, and academic integrity, suggesting an effort to uphold traditional academic values and encourage informed adoption. While the universities were at different stages of understanding and managing GenAI, they tended towards a comprehensive approach in formatting their guidance for internal stakeholders and assessment policies. The review also uncovered gaps in policymaking, such as the exclusion of non-academic staff, limited use of evidence-based practices, international misalignments, and a strong adherence to traditional academic paradigms. This scoping review provides a comprehensive and multifaceted overview of policy development in Asian universities, laying the groundwork for global discussions about the role of GenAI in higher education. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - While AI has the potential to streamline assessment development in higher education, there are concerns about its reliability, fairness, and potential to perpetuate bias. This study sought to understand the perceptions of academics and teaching and learning (T&L) specialists on the use of AI tools and large language models on assessment development, whether the private HE institution (PHEI) needs to change how it assesses students, and the types of assessments to be created. This topic is extremely relevant, as many higher education institutions (HEIs) are entering unchartered territory, and there is scant credible evidence on the prior-implementation reporting and evaluation of AI integration into assessment practices. Forty academics and T&L specialists at a PHEI in South Africa shared their perceptions. The study revealed two key themes: (a) AI use and (b) reconceptualizing assessments and T&L structures, indicating the need for HEIs to understand the synergies between AI and assessment practices. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

T2  - Social Sciences and Humanities Open
AB  - Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study explores the emerging trends in e-learning from the perspective of university faculty, who play a crucial role in shaping the future of education. The rapid shift to digital education during and after COVID-19 has presented challenges for university faculty to grapple with new e-learning technologies. A qualitative research design was used to develop deep insights into upcoming e-learning trends. Data were collected from a sample of 70 teachers (35 males and 35 females) through a random sampling from the university faculty in the capital territory of Pakistan. The data collected through semi-structured interviews was analyzed qualitatively for thematic analysis using a fuzzy inference system on MATLAB, resulting in a system accuracy of 92% and a miss rate of 8%.

T2  - Teaching English with Technology
AB  - Although there are claims that ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, is capable of assessing the writing of L2 learners accurately and consistently in the classroom, a number of recent studies have shown discrepancies between AI and human raters. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies investigating the intrareliability of ChatGPT scores. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT compared to teachers, as well as with itself, after being trained on a rubric. To accomplish this goal, the study adopted a quantitative correlational non-experimental design. A dataset of 100 writing assignments, submitted by a cohort of B1-level students at an international branch university in Egypt, was analyzed quantitatively. These assignments were initially evaluated and moderated by trained teachers (n=11), and subsequently, the same assignments were also assessed twice by ChatGPT. The findings indicated that teachers’ scores exhibited a higher level of accuracy compared to those generated by ChatGPT. The results also revealed that ChatGPT exhibits a moderate, yet questioned, level of intra-rater reliability. The weak-to-moderate correlations between ChatGPT and teacher scores raise concerns about the accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT’s scoring of writing assignments. The implications of the findings highlight the potential applications and limitations of ChatGPT in L2 writing assessment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the use of AI technologies in language education and provides insights into the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT as an evaluation tool for L2 writing. © (2023), (University of Nicosia).

T2  - New Directions for Teaching and Learning
AB  - This chapter investigates the integration of generative AI (GenAI), specifically ChatGPT, into institutional and course-level assessment at Western New England University. It explores the potential of GenAI to streamline the assessment process, making it more efficient, equitable, and objective. Through the development of a proprietary GenAI tool, the study examines GenAI's assessment of student evidence, including written assignments and computer coding tasks, against human assessment. It addresses challenges such as data collection, coordination, and the need for well-defined and precise rubrics. We found notable differences in GenAI and human scoring in some cases, indicating GenAI's potential in certain assessment contexts while also acknowledging its limitations in others. Our research suggests that GenAI could enhance educational assessment processes, but its integration requires addressing biases in training data and securing buy-in from various stakeholders. Using GenAI to handle particular routine tasks can potentially free up faculty to engage in richer discussions and educational improvements. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the critical intersections of AI, academic integrity, and disability in the context of a large undergraduate course. Our aim was to adapt the course to respond to generative AI (GenAI) to avoid entrenching barriers for students, and instead teach them how to use GenAI tools in ways that deepen their learning and uphold academic honesty. Grounded in disability justice and access pedagogies, we outline five design goals centered on guidelines for AI usage, education on responsible AI use, revised assessments, support for teaching assistants (TAs), and accessible materials. These activities are detailed in our methodology. In our findings, we provide a critical reflection of the course adaptation, taking up issues such as varying levels of familiarity with GenAI, students’ capacity to engage with course changes, resistance to GenAI, instructors’ relational shifts to AI, and feelings of demoralization among the teaching team. We conclude by offering practical recommendations for educators, calling for learning communities to view this disruption as an invitation to listen to disabled students. © 2024 The Author(s).

T2  - International Journal of Engineering Education
AB  - The technological innovation of open artificial intelligence (AI) brings more free and convenient resources for university students, and Information Engineering (IE) students have priority skills to enjoy, which may challenge their honest behavior. This study is one of the few cross-institution empirical studies in the Chinese context and 447 IE samples from five public universities are included in the quantitative research to investigate the effects of attitude, and intention on behavior toward academic misconduct (AM). The structural equation modeling technique was used to test the developed hypotheses, bootstrapping, and confidence intervals to test the mediating effect. It demonstrated that attitude was a significant predictive variable of intention and intention had a statistically significant effect on AM behavior, in which, the effect of attitudes factor on IE students’ engagement in AM behavior was mediated by intention. Pre-event educational intervention, monitoring AI technical support, and post-violation punishment are essential to help engineering students establish correct attitudes to resist the temptation of AM behavior and promote the sustainable development of engineering education. © 2024 Tempus Publications.

T2  - Advances in Physiology Education
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained massive interest with the public release of the conversational AI “ChatGPT, ” but it also has become a matter of concern for academia as it can easily be misused. We performed a quantitative evaluation of the performance of ChatGPT on a medical physiology university examination. Forty-one answers were obtained with ChatGPT and compared to the results of 24 students. The results of ChatGPT were significantly better than those of the students; the median (IQR) score was 75% (66–84%) for the AI compared to 56% (43–65%) for students (P < 0.001). The exam success rate was 100% for ChatGPT, whereas 29% (n ¼ 7) of students failed. ChatGPT could promote plagiarism and intellectual laziness among students and could represent a new and easy way to cheat, especially when evaluations are performed online. Considering that these powerful AI tools are now freely available, scholars should take great care to construct assessments that really evaluate student reflection skills and prevent AI-assisted cheating. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The release of the conversational artificial intelligence (AI) ChatGPT has become a matter of concern for academia as it can easily be misused by students for cheating purposes. We performed a quantitative evaluation of the performance of ChatGPT on a medical physiology university examination and observed that ChatGPT outperforms medical students obtaining significantly better grades. Scholars should therefore take great care to construct assessments crafted to really evaluate the student reflection skills and prevent AI-assisted cheating. 1043-4046/24 Copyright © 2024 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background: The recent artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT seems to offer a range of benefits in academic education while also raising concerns. Relevant literature encompasses issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as well as pedagogy and educational affordances; yet, no real-life implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process has been reported to our knowledge so far. Objective: This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods: In March 2023, a total of 77 second-year dental students of the European University Cyprus were divided into 2 groups and asked to compose a learning assignment on "Radiation Biology and Radiation Protection in the Dental Office,"working collaboratively in small subgroups, as part of the educational semester program of the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology module. Careful planning ensured a seamless integration of ChatGPT, addressing potential challenges. One group searched the internet for scientific resources to perform the task and the other group used ChatGPT for this purpose. Both groups developed a PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) presentation based on their research and presented it in class. The ChatGPT group students additionally registered all interactions with the language model during the prompting process and evaluated the final outcome; they also answered an open-ended evaluation questionnaire, including questions on their learning experience. Finally, all students undertook a knowledge examination on the topic, and the grades between the 2 groups were compared statistically, whereas the free-text comments of the questionnaires were thematically analyzed. Results: Out of the 77 students, 39 were assigned to the ChatGPT group and 38 to the literature research group. Seventy students undertook the multiple choice question knowledge examination, and examination grades ranged from 5 to 10 on the 0-10 grading scale. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that students of the ChatGPT group performed significantly better (P=.045) than students of the literature research group. The evaluation questionnaires revealed the benefits (human-like interface, immediate response, and wide knowledge base), the limitations (need for rephrasing the prompts to get a relevant answer, general content, false citations, and incapability to provide images or videos), and the prospects (in education, clinical practice, continuing education, and research) of ChatGPT. Conclusions: Students using ChatGPT for their learning assignments performed significantly better in the knowledge examination than their fellow students who used the literature research methodology. Students adapted quickly to the technological environment of the language model, recognized its opportunities and limitations, and used it creatively and efficiently. Implications for practice: the study underscores the adaptability of students to technological innovations including ChatGPT and its potential to enhance educational outcomes. Educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into curriculum design; awareness programs are warranted to educate both students and educators about the limitations of ChatGPT, encouraging critical engagement and responsible use.  ©Argyro Kavadella, Marco Antonio Dias da Silva, Eleftherios G Kaklamanos, Vasileios Stamatopoulos, Kostis Giannakopoulos.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This mixed-methods study aims to examine factors influencing academicians’ intentions to continue using AI-based chatbots by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and social network characteristics. Background AI-powered chatbots are gaining popularity across industries, including academia. However, empirical research on academicians’ adoption behavior is limited. This study proposes an integrated model incorporating TTF factors and social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness to understand academics’ continuance intentions. Methodology A qualitative study involving 31 interviews of academics from India examined attitudes and the potential role of social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness in adoption. Results showed positive sentiment towards chatbots and themes on how peer groups accelerate diffusion. In the second phase, a survey of 448 faculty members from prominent Indian universities was conducted to test the proposed research model. Contribution The study proposes and validates an integrated model of TTF and social network factors that influence academics’ continued usage intentions toward AI chatbots. It highlights the nuanced role of peer networks in shaping adoption. Findings Task and technology characteristics positively affected academics’ intentions to continue AI chatbot usage. Among network factors, density showed the strongest effect on TTF and perceived usefulness, while homophily and connectedness had partial effects. The study provides insights into designing appropriate AI tools for the academic context. Recommendations AI chatbot designers should focus on aligning features to academics’ task for Practitioners needs and preferences. Compatibility with academic work culture is critical. Given peer network influences, training and demonstrations to user groups can enhance adoption. Platforms should have capabilities for collaborative use. Targeted messaging customized to disciplines can resonate better with academic subgroups. Multidisciplinary influencers should be engaged. Concerns like plagiarism risks, privacy, and job impacts should be transparently addressed. Recommendations More studies are needed across academic subfields to understand nuanced for Researchers requirements and barriers. Further studies are recommended to investigate differences across disciplines and demographics, relative effects of specific network factors like size, proximity, and frequency of interaction, the role of academic leadership and institutional policies in enabling chatbot adoption, and how AI training biases impact usefulness perceptions and ethical issues. Impact on Society Increased productivity in academia through the appropriate and ethical use of AI can enhance quality, access, and equity in education. AI can assist in mundane tasks, freeing academics’ time for higher-order objectives like critical thinking development. Responsible AI design and policies considering socio-cultural aspects will benefit sustainable growth. With careful implementation, it can make positive impacts on student engagement, learning support, and research efficiency. Future Research Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impacts of AI chatbot usage in academia. Track usage behaviors over time as familiarity develops. Investigate differences across academic disciplines and roles. Requirements may vary for humanities versus STEM faculty or undergraduate versus graduate students. Assess user trust in AI and how it evolves with repeated usage, and examine trust-building strategies. Develop frameworks to assess pedagogical effectiveness and ethical risks of conversational agents in academic contexts.

T2  - Journal of Criminal Justice Education
AB  - OpenAI’s ChatGPT is an advanced large language model AI that has caused both excitement and concern in academia. TurnItIn and similar software programs are widely used in higher education to detect potential plagiarism. However, the extent to which such software can identify papers produced by ChatGPT remains unclear. The current study partially addressed this question by submitting five versions of short essays about criminological topics generated from ChatGPT to the TurnItIn software. Overall, the results indicated that TurnItIn adequately detected that the essays were not original works (mean percent plagiarized score = 31%). The analyses further illustrated that ChatGPT wrote at an exceedingly high level (mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 15.1) atypical of essays in higher education. Consequently, it appears that detection of AI-generated writing may be easier than initially assumed although the technology is bound to improve. Accordingly, possible strategies for approaching AI in higher education are proposed. © 2024 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

TI  - Redesigning Tertiary Educational Evaluation with AI: A Task-Based Analysis of LIS Students’ Assessment on Written Tests and Utilizing ChatGPT at NSTU
AU  - Yesmin, S.
T2  - Science and Technology Libraries
AB  - The AI tool ChatGPT has shaken the academic system and challenges conventional teaching-learning methods. Using a mixed method approach, the author adopted a task-based analysis to measure the Library and Information Science (LIS) students’ academic performance and integrity during the Artificial Intelligence, especially the ChatGPT trend. A group of 32 LIS final-year students were purposively selected as they completed all the basic courses of their discipline. A one-day session was divided into two phases–a written exam and an assignment through ChatGPT–held at the Institute of Information Sciences (IIS), Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU). Both examinations were administered using a questionnaire including a series of 15 tasks. A faculty member of IIS was tasked with reviewing the gathered answer scripts voluntarily. Results showed that it is too difficult to rank students’ positions based on ChatGPT-generated tasks, as the participant who placed in 20th position (scored 5 out of 30) among 32 in the written examination, placed in 2nd position (scored 25) in ChatGPT-generated assignment. It is encouraging that the similarity indices (by Turnitin) reached up to 89%, which is unacceptable under university regulations. However, none of these assignments included in-text citations and references, which is questionable from the standpoint of academic ethics. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Online learning has become increasingly popular, making the learning process more attractive. One of the most popular learning media is artificial intelligence (AI). However, students do not accept this technology at all. Therefore, this study examined the factors influencing accounting students' acceptance of AI in learning. The survey was conducted with 147 higher-education students who use AI as a learning medium. The data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 with the partial least square approach. The results showed that perceived usefulness influenced behavioral intention to use and satisfaction. However, perceived ease of use was only significant for satisfaction. Similarly, perceived confidence must be consistent with intention. Although it may influence perceived usefulness, other constructs, such as AI quality and personal innovativeness, can increase students' perceptions of the benefits and convenience of adopting AI in learning. Thus, this study contributes to the development of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information systems success model and is helpful to scholars, especially in applying AI in learning. They need to pay attention to the quality of AI, such as the accuracy of the information produced. Thus, the need to control the information from the AI only serves as a reference without requiring you to trust it completely. © 2024 The Author(s).

TI  - A critical review of GenAI policies in higher education assessment: a call to reconsider the “originality” of students’ work
AU  - Luo, J.
T2  - Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education
AB  - This study offers a critical examination of university policies developed to address recent challenges presented by generative AI (GenAI) to higher education assessment. Drawing on Bacchi’s ‘What’s the problem represented to be’ (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student’s independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students’ work is required. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The rapid proliferation of the Internet has sparked a resurgence of attention toward the function of novel artificial intelligence technologies in the higher education. The effective adoption of recent advancements in human-computer interaction is crucial for inclusive education and innovation, resulting in sustainable socioeconomic growth and development. Therefore, the present investigation focuses to examine various factors that exert an influence on acceptance and use of ChatGPT by marketing students. The research’s significance lies in the integrating the concept of system flexibility into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. An adapted questionnaire was administered to gather information, and statistical procedures were conducted on 309 valid responses. The study’s results revealed that habit was the most significant predictor of behavioral intention, with performance expectancy and effort expectancy following closely behind. However, the research shows that perceived risk is not a vital factor for marketing students, as they exhibit a heightened sense of control in regulating their online behavior. Besides, the implications presented in this study hold great significance for policymakers, educators, and top-level management personnel within higher education institutions to evaluate and update existing education policies to accommodate the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT into higher education. © 2024 Society for Marketing Advances.

TI  - The Ethics of Emotional Artificial Intelligence: A Mixed Method Analysis
AU  - Ghotbi, N.
T2  - Asian Bioethics Review
AB  - Emotions play a significant role in human relations, decision-making, and the motivation to act on those decisions. There are ongoing attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to read human emotions, and to predict human behavior or actions that may follow those emotions. However, a person’s emotions cannot be easily identified, measured, and evaluated by others, including automated machines and algorithms run by AI. The ethics of emotional AI is under research and this study has examined the emotional variables as well as the perception of emotional AI in two large random groups of college students in an international university in Japan, with a heavy representation of Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and other Asian nationalities. Surveys with multiple close-ended questions and an open-ended essay question regarding emotional AI were administered for quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. The results demonstrate how ethically questionable results may be obtained through affective computing and by searching for correlations in a variety of factors in collected data to classify individuals into certain categories and thus aggravate bias and discrimination. Nevertheless, the qualitative study of students’ essays shows a rather optimistic view over the use of emotional AI, which helps underscore the need to increase awareness about the ethical pitfalls of AI technologies in the complex field of human emotions. © 2022, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on loss in decision-making, laziness, and privacy concerns among university students in Pakistan and China. Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Academic integrity surrounding the use of generative AI in higher education: Lenses from ICT college students
AU  - Plecerda, L.P.
T2  - Environment and Social Psychology
AB  - The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) in education marks a transformative shift in teaching, learning, and assessment practices. GenAI technologies have evolved from being simple conversational agents to highly advanced systems capable of generating human-like text, solving complex problems, assisting in creative writing, tutoring, and even providing personalized feedback to students. This paper explored the use of GenAI in education with emphasis on its implications towards academic integrity. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) college students (n=30) were purposively sampled to be interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions about the use of GenAI in their program. Thematic analysis was carried out to identify emerging themes and assess the implications of GenAI use in education, particularly ICT learning processes. Students believed that GenAI offers significant benefits, such as personalized learning, assistance in creative writing, tutoring, coding, and grading, which enhance students’ learning experiences by providing instant feedback and helping them understand difficult concepts. Concerns about over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty have emerged, as some students use AI tools to bypass intellectual effort, raising questions about the authenticity of their work. ICT students expressed concerns about GenAI fostering cheating and undermining academic independence. Despite these issues, students remain optimistic about GenAI’s role in education, advocating for clear guidelines on its appropriate use to balance its benefits with the need for academic integrity. The integration of GenAI in educational settings necessitates careful management to ensure that it supports, rather than diminishes, the learning process. © 2024 by author(s).

TI  - Factors Affecting Faculty Members’ Readiness to Integrate Artificial Intelligence into Their Teaching Practices: A Study from the Saudi Higher Education Context
AU  - Alnasib, B.N.M.
T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for about three decades. However, use of AI in pedagogy on a large scale and examination of its impact on teaching practices in higher education are under-researched topics. This study examined the readiness of 465 faculty members at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia to integrate AI into their teaching practices as well as the factors influencing that readiness. A 46-item online survey was used to collect data. The results show that the respondents demonstrated an average readiness to integrate AI into their teaching (M = 3.40, SD = 0.841). Statistically significant correlations were found at the 0.01 significance level between faculty members’ readiness to incorporate AI into teaching and the perceived benefit of AI in higher education and teaching; attitudes towards AI; behavioral intentions to use AI; and facilitative conditions for AI use. Significant differences were found at the 0.05 significance level regarding faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI into their teaching according to gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no statistically significant differences were found at the 0.05 significance level in terms of faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI into their teaching according to college type or academic rank. Thus, it is recommended that faculty members’ readiness to integrate AI and their knowledge of and skills concerning AI and how to use it to improve educational institution outcomes be enhanced. © 2023 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

TI  - ChatGPT in higher education: Considerations for academic integrity and student learning
AU  - Sullivan, M.
AU  - Kelly, A.

T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - The release of ChatGPT has sparked significant academic integrity concerns in higher education. However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning, and consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, there has been very little academic literature published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It explores several key themes, including university responses, academic integrity concerns, the limitations and weaknesses of AI tool outputs, and opportunities for student learning. The data reveals mixed public discussion and university responses, with a focus mainly on academic integrity concerns and opportunities for innovative assessment design. There has also been a lack of public discussion about the potential for ChatGPT to enhance participation and success for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the student voice is poorly represented in media articles to date. This article considers these trends and the impact of AI tools on student learning at university. © 2023.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Implications for Academic Cheating: Expanding the Dimensions of Responsible Human-AI Collaboration with ChatGPT and Bard
AU  - Oravec, J.A.
T2  - Journal of Interactive Learning Research
AB  - Cheating is a growing academic and ethical concern in higher education. The technological “arms race” that involves cheating-detection system developers versus technology-savvy students is attracting increased attention to cheating issues; it is also generating iterations of technological innovations as corporations, higher educational institutions, and legal experts attempt to control the situation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has added new dimensions to academic cheating challenges as students (as well as faculty and staff) can easily access powerful systems for generating content that can be presented in assignments, exams, or published papers as their own. AI methodology is also providing some emerging anti-cheating approaches, including facial recognition and watermarking. This paper provides an overview of human/AI collaboration approaches and frames some educational misuses of ChatGPT as forms of “misattributed co-authorship.” As with other kinds of collaborations, the work that students produce with AI assistance can be presented in transparent and straightforward modes or (unfortunately) in opaquer and ethically-problematic ways. However, rather than just for catching or entrapping students, the emerging varieties of technological cheating-detection strategies can be used to assist students in learning how to document and attribute properly their AI-empowered as well as human-human collaborations. Construing misuses of ChatGPT as misattributed co-authorship can recognize the growing capabilities of AI systems and how stressing responsible and mindful usage by students can help prepare them for a highly collaborative, AI-saturated future. © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

AU  - McIlwraith, T.
AU  - Finnis, E.
AU  - Jones, S.
T2  - Anthropologica
AB  - We explore playfully the capacity of an artificial intelligence text generation engine called GPT-3 to produce credible academic texts. Departing from a concern raised by colleagues about the possibility of using GPT-3 to cheat in academia, particularly at the undergraduate level, we interact with the GPT-3 interface as nerdy novices to learn what it could produce. The outputs from the GPT-3 text generation engine are incredible, at times surprising, and often terrible. We point to ways in which GPT-3 might be used by students to produce written work and reasons why most instructors, most of the time, could see through what GPT-3 has produced (at least for now). In our experiments, we learn that GPT-3 can be a productive collaborator in paper design but wonder if this is ethical. In short, while fun and somewhat addictive to experiment with, we must pay attention to the potential ways that AI text generation may begin to appear in the anthropology classroom. © 2023 University of Toronto.

TI  - ‘Words are Flowing Out Like Endless Rain Into a Paper Cup’: ChatGPT & Law School Assessments
AU  - Hargreaves, S.
T2  - Legal Education Review
AB  - ChatGPT is a sophisticated large-language model able to answer high-level questions in a way that is does not trigger conventional plagiarism detectors. Concerns have been raised that and similar forms of ‘generative AI’ pose a significant threat to academic integrity in higher education. To evaluate this risk in the context of legal education specifically, this project had ChatGPT (using the GPT3.5 model available in January 2023) generate answers to twenty-four different exams from an English-language law school based in a common law jurisdiction. It found that the system performed best on exams that were essay-based and asked students to discuss international legal instruments or general legal principles not necessarily specific to any jurisdiction. It performed worst on exams that featured problem-style or “issue spotting” questions asking students to apply an invented factual scenario to local legislation or jurisprudence. While the project suggests that for the most part conventional law school assessments are for the time being relatively immune from the threat generative AI brings, the project provides only a baseline snapshot of how large-language models tackle assessment in higher education. As both the technology improves and students learn how to harness it, increasingly fewer forms of assessment will be beyond its reach. However, rather than attempt to block students from using AI as part of learning and assessment, this paper instead proposes three ways students may be taught to use it in appropriate and ethical ways. While it is clear that generative AI will change how universities teach and assess (across disciplines), a solution of prevention or denial is no solution at all. © 2023, Australasian Law Academics Association.

AB  - Public access to artificial intelligence, and specifically to ChatGPT, is presenting challenges in the professional training of occupational therapists. In this context, this essay aims to describe the impact of artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on ChatGPT, on the training of occupational therapists and proposes strategies to integrate these technologies into higher education from an integrative, ethical perspective, in line with the values and principles of academic integrity. While this tool can be used to provide theoretical knowledge and enhance content learning, it also poses a risk for dishonest behaviors in the academic realm. Therefore, it is essential that educators understand its use and promote experiential methodologies that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and reflection. The challenge lies in the implementation of policies and strategies that promote the development of professional skills and the ethical and effective use of these technologies in training future occupational therapists, such as declaring its use in written works, modeling by teachers, and integration into training methodologies. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate attitudes of both students and teachers concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the L2 classroom. The study was a descriptive, qualitative, mixedmethods case study whose data were taken from a purposive, convenient sample at a private, English-speaking university during the Summer Semester 2023 in Beirut, Lebanon. Data collection primarily involved an online survey on Google forms which was given to a sample of 49 students taking a research-based English 202 course of which 46 were completed. Afterwards, six English teachers and six students were chosen based on their voluntary will to participate in individual interviews for the former and semi-structured focus group interviews for the latter. The findings revealed that approximately 85% of students did indeed use AI unethically to get ideas for their assignments, assist them in their projects' “blue-prints” or do their assignments/projects altogether. The findings also revealed that a “love/hate” relationship seemed to dictate students' relationships with AI, where students did indeed make use of AI but were distrusting of it for privacy and equity concerns. Finally, findings also revealed that most of the interviewed instructors' readiness to undergo training for AI was more to monitor students' potential misuse of it. The article purposes a suggestive revamping of course learning objectives due to students' inclinations to misuse AI to do their coursework with 89.4% of students willing to use AI to complete their coursework should university punitive measures be removed; furthermore, the article equally proposes future research investigating the impact and use of AI in the higher educational classroom on student performance and that it be used with a “grain of salt” as it may unleash a Pandora's box of future generations graduating without the necessary know-how in delicate professions of medicine, nursing, engineering, architecture among others. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Navigating the Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: An Analysis of Seven Global AI Ethics Policies
AU  - Slimi, Z.
AU  - Carballido, B.V.
T2  - TEM Journal
AB  - AI use in higher education raises ethical concerns that must be addressed. Biased algorithms pose a significant threat, especially if used in admission or grading processes, as they could have devastating effects on students. Another issue is the displacement of human educators by AI systems, and there are concerns about transparency and accountability as AI becomes more integrated into decision-making processes. This paper examined three AI objectives related higher education: biased algorithms, AI and decision-making, and human displacement. Discourse analysis of seven AI ethics policies was conducted, including those from UNESCO, China, the European Commission, Google, MIT, Sanford HAI, and Carnegie Mellon. The findings indicate that stakeholders must work together to address these challenges and ensure responsible AI deployment in higher education while maximizing its benefits. Fair use and protecting individuals, especially those with vulnerable characteristics, are crucial. Gender bias must be avoided in algorithm development, learning data sets, and AI decision-making. © 2023 Zouhaier Slimi & Beatriz Villarejo Carballido; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - This article investigates the perspectives of Romanian academics on implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE). The article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies’ leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of academics, to gains in the learning–teaching process, improvements in students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves, and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results of this research is mainly empirical and practical. These opinions should be used as resources for managers of HE institutions to develop better policies concerning the implementation of AI in HE and for strategic vision toward AI, with the ultimate purpose of achieving progress and prosperity for the entire society. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - The use and abuse of artificial intelligence-enabled machine translation in the EFL classroom: An exploratory study
AU  - Alharbi, W.
T2  - Journal of Education and e-Learning Research
AB  - The integration of machine translation (MT) and artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced the precision of MT systems producing translations that rival the quality of skilled human translators. This innovation has broadened the applicability of AI-enabled MT systems attracting users for a variety of purposes. This paper explores the following areas: the application of AI-enabled MT, specifically Google Translate (GT) in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. Empirical findings and recent research indicate that students are increasingly reliant on MT particularly in higher educational settings where English is not their first language. The purpose of this research is to provide insight on the practices, beliefs and goals of EFL learners who use GT in the classroom. Data was gathered from 234 university students through a questionnaire along with pre- and post-tests to compare the quality of writing drafts created with and without the aid of GT. The findings are consistent with those of previous research conducted worldwide highlighting the immense potential of AI-enabled MT in not only boosting students' learning experiences but also cultivating more independent learners. The study also indicates that students have positive attitudes towards GT and employ diverse search strategies to address various language-related challenges. © 2023 by the author.

T2  - Information Sciences Letters
AB  - Due to COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face teaching has been replaced by online education to reduce the risks of spreading the Coronavirus. Online examination is an important asset in the context of online learning to assess students, but observing students during testing and ensuring that they do not engage in misbehavior remains a major issue. Human observation is one of the most common methods when conducting an exam to ensure that students do not perform any unexpected behaviors, by entering the student in a laboratory or hall at the university and observing him throughout the exam period visually and soundly. However, this method is costly and labor-intensive. In this paper, a system is created that monitors students during an online test automatically based on face recognition and voice recognition using a machine learning algorithm. The camera on the student's computer will be used to track the student's facial movements, pupils, and lip movements, monitoring the student's behavior throughout the test, and stopping any unexpected behavior. In this system, there are two parts: facial recognition and unexpected behavior detection. The face was recognized with an accuracy of 98.3%, and unexpected behavior was detected with an accuracy of 97.6%. There is also an opportunity to increase accuracy by improving the quality of the images in the dataset. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

T2  - STEM Education
AB  - The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat in higher education shows excellent potential for transformation. However, this integration also raises issues in maintaining academic integrity and preventing plagiarism. In this study, we investigate and analyze practical approaches for efficiently harnessing the potential of GAI while simultaneously ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. Despite the potential to expedite the learning process and improve accessibility, concerns regarding academic misconduct highlight the necessity for the implementation of novel GAI frameworks for higher education. To effectively tackle these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, PAIGE (Promoting Assignment Integrity using Generative AI in Education). This framework emphasizes the ethical integration of GAI, promotes active student interaction, and cultivates opportunities for peer learning experiences. Higher education institutions can effectively utilize the PAIGE framework to leverage the promise of GAI while ensuring the preservation of assignment integrity. This approach paves the way for a responsible and thriving future in Generative AI-driven education. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by AIMS, LLC.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - This study investigates university teachers’ relationships with emerging technologies by focusing on the uptake of artificial intelligence in higher education practices. We utilise an experimental philosophy approach to i) determine university teachers’ intuitions around universities’ responsibilities to adopt new artificial intelligence technologies, ii) understand the conditions under which university teachers consider artificial intelligence defensible and, hence, would be willing to introduce such tools and services into their daily practice and iii) specify teachers’ self-reported knowledge of artificial intelligence. An online survey, where participants were sent one of three different cases (Case A related to first-generation students, Case B, an archetypical student, Case C, students with a learning disability), and 18 identical questions across all three cases. The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Background: ChatGPT is a conversational large language model that has the potential to revolutionize knowledge acquisition. However, the impact of this technology on the quality of education is still unknown considering the risks and concerns surrounding ChatGPT use. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the usability and acceptability of this promising tool. As an innovative technology, the intention to use ChatGPT can be studied in the context of the technology acceptance model (TAM). Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a TAM-based survey instrument called TAME-ChatGPT (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption) that could be employed to examine the successful integration and use of ChatGPT in health care education. Methods: The survey tool was created based on the TAM framework. It comprised 13 items for participants who heard of ChatGPT but did not use it and 23 items for participants who used ChatGPT. Using a convenient sampling approach, the survey link was circulated electronically among university students between February and March 2023. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess the construct validity of the survey instrument. Results: The final sample comprised 458 respondents, the majority among them undergraduate students (n=442, 96.5%). Only 109 (23.8%) respondents had heard of ChatGPT prior to participation and only 55 (11.3%) self-reported ChatGPT use before the study. EFA analysis on the attitude and usage scales showed significant Bartlett tests of sphericity scores (P<.001) and adequate Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measures (0.823 for the attitude scale and 0.702 for the usage scale), confirming the factorability of the correlation matrices. The EFA showed that 3 constructs explained a cumulative total of 69.3% variance in the attitude scale, and these subscales represented perceived risks, attitude to technology/social influence, and anxiety. For the ChatGPT usage scale, EFA showed that 4 constructs explained a cumulative total of 72% variance in the data and comprised the perceived usefulness, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, and behavior/cognitive factors. All the ChatGPT attitude and usage subscales showed good reliability with Cronbach α values >.78 for all the deduced subscales. Conclusions: The TAME-ChatGPT demonstrated good reliability, validity, and usefulness in assessing health care students’ attitudes toward ChatGPT. The findings highlighted the importance of considering risk perceptions, usefulness, ease of use, attitudes toward technology, and behavioral factors when adopting ChatGPT as a tool in health care education. This information can aid the stakeholders in creating strategies to support the optimal and ethical use of ChatGPT and to identify the potential challenges hindering its successful implementation. Future research is recommended to guide the effective adoption of ChatGPT in health care education. ©Malik Sallam, Nesreen A Salim, Muna Barakat, Kholoud Al-Mahzoum, Ala'a B Al-Tammemi, Diana Malaeb, Rabih Hallit, Souheil Hallit.

T2  - College and Research Libraries News
AB  - Figure 1 was what was generated when we asked ChatGPT, the generative AI system that has been the subject of a thousand hot takes about how it’s disrupting academia-as-we-know-it, to describe itself for an academic librarian audience. Perhaps it’s learning a bit too much from the public relations documents that were a part of the vast amounts of data it was trained on, when it describes itself as “highly relevant,” “invaluable,” and “accurate.” It did not, however, bring up the caveat that greets you when you open up ChatGPT itself: that it “may occasionally generate incorrect information,” that it “may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content,” or that it has “limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021.” In addition, it doesn’t bring up the reddest of academic red flags—that ChatGPT provides an easy way for students to cheat and plagiarize. The Atlantic has claimed that because of ChatGPT and other AI, “the undergraduate essay [which] has been at the center of humanistic pedagogy for generations . . . is about to be disrupted from the ground up.” A writer at Times Higher Education has suggested that allowing AI to replace a student’s creative voice means “abandoning our responsibilities as educators.” © 2023 Amy B.

T2  - Science and Engineering Ethics
AB  - An anthropogenic global catastrophic risk is a human-induced risk that threatens sustained and wide-scale loss of life and damage to civilisation across the globe. In order to understand how new research on governance mechanisms for emerging technologies might assuage such risks, it is important to ask how perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes towards the governance of global catastrophic risk within the research community shape the conduct of potentially risky research. The aim of this study is to deepen our understanding of emerging technology research culture as it relates to global catastrophic risks, and to shed new light on how new research governance mechanisms might be developed. We analyse in-depth interviews with leading AI and biotech researchers both from universities and the private sector. We develop new insights in terms of four salient themes. First, ‘engineering mindset’, which highlights the premium placed by many interviewees on pursuing interesting research about the physical world for its own sake. Second, ‘self-government’, which looks at how self-regulation of technological development currently occurs. Third, ‘pure incentives’, focussing on how career and other incentives shapes research. Fourth, ‘norms and persuasion’, which examines the role of moral considerations in guiding the research choices of scientists. We end by considering the implications of these findings for future research on governance of anthropogenic global catastrophic risk. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The advent of transformative technologies, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool, significantly impacts the future of education, society, and the economy. Drawing on the theory of knowledge socialism and public goods, this paper critically examines the potential impact of ChatGPT in the context of China's high-tech development and higher education. We believe these technologies resonate with the principles of knowledge socialism by promoting decentralization, openness, and collective intelligence and are poised to reshape the education sector and beyond. The non-competitive and non-exclusive nature of ChatGPT makes it a public good with significant social benefits. In the educational domain, it has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning by providing students with convenient, personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and multilingual support. However, despite its benefits, educators, and users must work to overcome its limitations, such as limited expertise, language understanding, reasoning skills, and potential risks associated with privacy, security, and misinformation. This article discusses the need to prepare students for a future heavily impacted by ai, which requires a reassessment of digital literacy and competencies. Doing so would require leveraging ai tools and promoting human-centered approaches, developing higher-order thinking skills, emphasizing emotional education, and teaching academic ethics. In addition, introducing ai tools like ChatGPT in higher education requires regulation to prevent plagiarism and improve independent problem-solving. This paper further explores the impact of ChatGPT on China's technological development. The global attention attracted by ChatGPT has stimulated the growth of the ai industry and prompted the emergence of domestic products and applications in countries such as China. It is critical to harmonize the enforcement of competition laws and capitalize on the contributions of sizable enterprises in the realm of technological innovation and research. © 2023 Beijing International Review of Education.

AB  - Oral presentation is a popular type of assessment in undergraduate degree programs. However, presentation delivery and grading pose considerable challenges to students and faculty alike. For the former, many students who learn English as an additional language may fear giving oral presentations in English due to a lack of confidence. For the latter, faculty who teach multiple classes and have many students may find it difficult to spend adequate time helping students refine their communication skills. This study examines an AI-assisted presentation platform that was built to offer students more opportunities for presentation training without the need for faculty intervention. Surveys with students and teachers were conducted to inform the design of the platform. After a preliminary platform was developed, two methods were employed to evaluate its reliability: a beta test with 24 students and a comparison of AI and human scoring of the presentation performance of 36 students. It was found that students are highly receptive to the platform, but there are noticeable differences between AI and human scoring abilities. The results reveal some limitations of AI and human raters, and emphasize the potential benefit of exploring collaborative AI–human intelligence. © 2022 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice
AB  - The OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3, or Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer was released in November 2022 without significant warning, and has taken higher education by storm since. The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars. Practitioner Notes 1. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 has taken higher education by storm with threats of plagiarism and integrity as key concerns. 2. We argue that effective teacher leadership is needed to develop student character so they use ChatGPT for good, rather than for personal benefit. 3. ChatGPT can create new and innovative authentic assessment in higher education. 4. ChatGPT offers students the opportunity to simplify the learning process to create less distraction, and more flow. © 2023, University of Wollongong. All rights reserved.

T2  - International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning
AB  - This paper highlights the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and text-generating models such as ChatGPT (GPT-Generative Pretrained Transformer) on Ukrainian education. It has been found that the introduction of this tool is both beneficial and problematic. On the one hand, it saves time for the information search, facilitates the research process for both teachers and students through proposing ideas, and creates education-related content that emulates human writing. On the other hand, ChatGPT sometimes outputs biased or unverified information that causes misunderstanding among the participants in the educational process. Moreover, in the case of inappropriate application, this tool limits the creativity of the students and decreases their critical thinking skills. The research is based on a survey (Google Forms) distributed through Facebook groups and university networks all over Ukraine. 1035 educational and pedagogical practitioners and teachers took part in the study. The results obtained from the respondents indicate that there are opportunities for the successful implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process. A significant majority of 83.6% of the respondents confirmed that the impact of AI depends on its usage. The survey also highlights various areas for ChatGPT improvements, such as “understanding context,” “giving more accurate answers,” “improving visual capability,” etc. However, it is inevitable to understand that combining human intellectual capability and ChatGPT potential goes beyond the boundaries of human possibilities, speeds up the process of innovative idea generation, and enables the educational process to be more meaningful and effective. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

AB  - In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Distance learning has spread nowadays on a large scale across the world, which has led to many challenges in education such as invigilation and learning coordination. These challenges have attracted the attention of many researchers aiming at providing high quality and credibility monitoring of students. Distance learning has offered an effective education alternative to traditional learning in higher education. The lecturers in universities face difficulties in understanding students’ emotions and abnormal behaviors during educational sessions and e-exams. The purpose of this study is to use computer vision algorithms and deep learning algorithms to develop a new system that supports lecturers in monitoring and managing students during online learning sessions and e-exams. To achieve the proposed objective, the system employs software methods, computer vision algorithms, and deep learning algorithms. Semi-structural interviews were also used as feedback to enhance the system. The findings showed that the system achieved high accuracy for student identification in real time, student follow-up during the online session, and cheating detection. Future work can focus on developing additional tools to assist students with special needs and speech recognition to improve the follow-up facial recognition system’s ability to detect cheating during e-exams in distance learning. © 2022 by the authors.

T2  - Asian Bioethics Review
AB  - To evaluate the moral awareness of college students regarding artificial intelligence (AI) systems, we have examined 467 surveys collected from 152 Japanese and 315 non-Japanese students in an international university in Japan. The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion and robots’ rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI (3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned about AI control of society (− 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were less concerned about unemployment (− 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more concerned about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05). The study concludes that the moral awareness of college students regarding AI technologies is quite limited and recommends including the ethics of AI in the curriculum. © 2021, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In August 2020, students took to the streets of London in a mass protest over their A-level results (that determine entry to university), chanting 'F∗ck the algorithm.' Their A-level grades had been determined by an algorithm that depended on past school performance, a system of teacher ratings, and for smaller student groups, the use of Centre Assessed Grades. Commendably Ofqual (the U.K. Government Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) were transparent in their use of the algorithm so that affected stakeholders were informed of the algorithm's existence and the key details of how it was developed. The design of the data set produced an algorithm with biased outputs, which hardcoded preexisting educational, policy, and societal biases. Due to the large numbers of students, the single 'results day' output and the wider interests of schools, teachers, parents, and universities, the unfairness of the outcome was magnified. Add to this that the students were, by definition, academically proficient individuals, many of whom derived from privileged and supportive backgrounds, which meant that they had the awareness and capacity to challenge. Hence, the impact of this biased algorithm was not received silently and so it was hard to deny, deflect, and dismiss. However, this is not always the case, and many systems are deployed with similar biases and harmful outcomes but the impact is dissipated over time and individuals, and therefore not so immediately obvious and easy to challenge. This is particularly the case when the people impacted do not have the advantages that enabled the A-level students to challenge. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Contract cheating, a form of academic misconduct in which students outsource assessment activities to third parties, is a topic of concern among educators. As similarity-detection systems are ineffective at detecting contract cheating, some institutions have turned to intensely criticised proctoring systems, however student and educator bodies report high costs and privacy concerns. Oral assessment is an alternative assessment approach that provides valuable interpersonal and communication skills in graduates and can naturally help detect and deter cheating. However, oral assessment is typically time-consuming, and in larger courses, it is challenging to validate respondents' identity. Advancements in machine learning approaches can scale time-consuming tasks that previously required prohibitive educator effort. One such system, Deep Speaker, is a speaker identification and verification system that can verify if two audio samples resemble speech from the same person with high accuracy. This paper presents an innovative tool that integrates an online oral assessment tool, Real Talk, with Deep Speaker. This proposed system facilitates scalable student-tutor discussions while providing longitudinal student identity validation with minimal cost and impact for institutions and addressing student privacy concerns. We evaluated the system and showed that student audio responses collected via oral discussion tools are suitable for verification. We then discuss the impact our system may have when applied in higher education. We posit that institutions can use such approaches to detect cases of contract cheating, enhance learning outcomes, and pave the way for more student-friendly assessment and discussion models in online education. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is the fourth industrial revolution, and in higher education it will fundamentally transform the work of academics and higher education administrators. AI will also have several implications for students, including a reconsideration of what sorts of skills and knowledge should be taught and developed in the academy to prepare students for digital working lives. As social work educators, we have begun to wonder what the implications of AI in the academy will have for social work education. For educators, there are implications for pedagogy that go well beyond the introduction of new digital tools that merely integrate into existing teaching models and practices. This is because AI will not simply add to existing teaching modes and practices, but will fundamentally transform teaching and learning. Drawing on recent literature and research into in AI and higher education, this article explores possible future implications for social work education. We identify the transformative and disruptive potential of AI in higher education, and consider how this intersects with the ethical and relational side of social work as a profession. Implications for social work education are canvassed  © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The British Association of Social Workers. All rights reserved.

TI  - Who Will Watch the Watchmen? The Ethico-political Arrangements of Algorithmic Proctoring for Academic Integrity
AU  - Henry, J.V.
AU  - Oliver, M.
T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - Critics of artificial intelligence have suggested that the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency (FATE) have been used for ‘ethics washing’, in order to appease industrial interests. In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AU  - Rahman, A.
T2  - International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research
AB  - The COVID-19-induced lockdown forced education institutes to use different synchronous and asynchronous assessment techniques. The present study is a case investigation of the Artificial Intelligence-based Online Proctored Examination (OPE) adopted by Nowgong College (Autonomous), Assam, India, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It follows a hybrid approach to understand the OPE mechanisms; to consider challenges faced therein; to assess its efficacy based on students' perception and satisfaction; and finally, to ascertain the perceived issues and concerns of students. Information from multiple sources was gathered including semi-structured interview with representatives of the exam controlling body, document analysis, observation and a survey of 209 randomly selected students; different parameters of OPE, constructed as per the attributes of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), were considered. The qualitative data were analysed thematically, while the quantitative data were analysed according to frequency, percentage, mean, sd and one sample t-test. The results revealed that additional costs, lack of compatible devices, low bandwidth in rural areas, technical inability of students are the major challenges in implementing OPE successfully. Students' perception of OPE was found to be significantly positive and the sampled students were significantly satisfied with their overall experiences in OPE. However, students were found to be significantly negative and reluctant about its future use, as they experienced various technical and financial issues, and were concerned about the environmental and psychological aspects. Thus, the insights from this study yield significant implications for stakeholders, which could assist in ensuring a robust and scalable OPE in the future.  © Authors.

AB  - The way people travel, organise their time, and acquire information has changed due to information technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are mechanisms that evolved from data management and developing processes. Incorporating these mechanisms into business is a trend many different industries, including education, have identified as game-changers. As a result, education platforms and applications are more closely aligned with learners’ needs and knowledge, making the educational process more efficient. Therefore, AI and ML have great potential in e-learning and higher education institutions (HEI). Thus, the article aims to deter-mine its potential and use areas in higher education based on secondary research and document analysis (literature review), content analysis, and primary research (survey). As referent points for this research, multiple academic, scientific, and commercial sources were used to obtain a broader picture of the research subject. Furthermore, the survey was implemented among students in the Republic of Serbia, with 103 respondents to generate data and information on how much knowledge of AI and ML is held by the student population, mainly to understand both opportunities and challenges involved in AI and ML in HEI. The study addresses critical issues, like common knowledge and stance of research bases regarding AI and ML in HEI; best practices regarding usage of AI and ML in HEI; students’ knowledge of AI and ML; and students’ attitudes regarding AI and ML opportunities and challenges in HEI. In statistical considerations, aiming to evaluate if the indicators were considered reflexive and, in this case, belong to the same theoretical dimension, the Correlation Matrix was presented, followed by the Composite Reliability. Finally, the results were evalu-ated by regression analysis. The results indicated that AI and ML are essential technologies that enhance learning, primarily through students’ skills, collaborative learning in HEI, and an accessible research environment. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluating the prospects for university-based ethical governance in artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation
AU  - Hine, C.
T2  - Research Ethics
AB  - There has been considerable debate around the ethical issues raised by data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence. Ethical principles for the field have focused on the need to ensure that such technologies are used for good rather than harm, that they enshrine principles of social justice and fairness, that they protect privacy, respect human autonomy and are open to scrutiny. While development of such principles is well advanced, there is as yet little consensus on the mechanisms appropriate for ethical governance in this field. This paper examines the prospects for the university ethics committee to undertake effective review of research conducted on data-driven technologies in the university context. Challenges identified include: the relatively narrow focus of university-based ethical review on the human subjects research process and lack of capacity to anticipate downstream impacts; the difficulties of accommodating the complex interplay of academic and commercial interests in the field; and the need to ensure appropriate expertise from both specialists and lay voices. Overall, the challenges identified sharpen appreciation of the need to encourage a joined-up and effective system of ethical governance that fosters an ethical culture rather than replacing ethical reflection with bureaucracy. © The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - AI recruitment algorithms and the dehumanization problem
AU  - Fritts, M.
AU  - Cabrera, F.
T2  - Ethics and Information Technology
AB  - According to a recent survey by the HR Research Institute, as the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common in the workplace, HR professionals are worried that the use of recruitment algorithms will lead to a “dehumanization” of the hiring process. Our main goals in this paper are threefold: (i) to bring attention to this neglected issue, (ii) to clarify what exactly this concern about dehumanization might amount to, and (iii) to sketch an argument for why dehumanizing the hiring process is ethically suspect. After distinguishing the use of the term “dehumanization” in this context (i.e. removing the human presence) from its more common meaning in the interdisciplinary field of dehumanization studies (i.e. conceiving of other humans as subhuman), we argue that the use of hiring algorithms may negatively impact the employee-employer relationship. We argue that there are good independent reasons to accept a substantive employee-employer relationship, as well as an applicant-employer relationship, both of which are consistent with a stakeholder theory of corporate obligations. We further argue that dehumanizing the hiring process may negatively impact these relationships because of the difference between the values of human recruiters and the values embedded in recruitment algorithms. Drawing on Nguyen’s (in: Lackey, Applied Epistemology, Oxford University Press, 2021) critique of how Twitter “gamifies communication”, we argue that replacing human recruiters with algorithms imports artificial values into the hiring process. We close by briefly considering some ways to potentially mitigate the problems posed by recruitment algorithms, along with the possibility that some difficult trade-offs will need to be made. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.

T2  - Nurse Education Today
AB  - Background: Despite powerful efforts to maximize nursing school enrollment, schools and colleges of nursing are faced with high rates of attrition and low rates of completion. Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80% of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90% after the second college year and 99% after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - From responsible robotics towards a human rights regime oriented to the challenges of robotics and artificial intelligence
AU  - Liu, H.-Y.
AU  - Zawieska, K.
T2  - Ethics and Information Technology
AB  - As the aim of the responsible robotics initiative is to ensure that responsible practices are inculcated within each stage of design, development and use, this impetus is undergirded by the alignment of ethical and legal considerations towards socially beneficial ends. While every effort should be expended to ensure that issues of responsibility are addressed at each stage of technological progression, irresponsibility (meaning a lack of responsibility) is inherent within the nature of robotics technologies from a theoretical perspective that threatens to thwart the endeavour. This is because the concept of responsibility, despite being treated as such, is not monolithic: rather this seemingly unified concept consists of converging and confluent concepts that shape the idea of what we colloquially call responsibility. From a different perspective, robotics will be simultaneously responsible and irresponsible depending on the particular concept of responsibility that is foregrounded: an observation that cuts against the grain of the drive towards responsible robotics. This problem is further compounded by responsible design and development as contrasted to responsible use. From a different perspective, the difficulty in defining the concept of responsibility in robotics is because human responsibility is the main frame of reference. Robotic systems are increasingly expected to achieve the human-level performance, including the capacities associated with responsibility and other criteria which are necessary to act responsibly. This subsists within a larger phenomenon where the difference between humans and non-humans, be it animals or artificial systems, appears to be increasingly blurred, thereby disrupting orthodox understandings of responsibility. This paper seeks to supplement the responsible robotics impulse by proposing a complementary set of human rights directed specifically against the harms arising from robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The relationship between responsibilities of the agent and the rights of the patient suggest that a rights regime is the other side of responsibility coin. The major distinction of this approach is to invert the power relationship: while human agents are perceived to control robotic patients, the prospect for this to become reversed is beginning. As robotic technologies become ever more sophisticated, and even genuinely complex, asserting human rights directly against robotic harms become increasingly important. Such an approach includes not only developing human rights that ‘protect’ humans (in a negative, defensive, sense) but also ‘strengthen’ people against the challenges introduced by robotics and AI (in a positive, empowering, manner) [This distinction parallels Berlin’s negative and positive concepts of liberty (Berlin, in Liberty, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002)], by emphasising the social and reflective character of the notion of humanness as well as the difference between the human and nonhuman. This will allow using the human frame of reference as constitutive of, rather than only subject to, the robotic and AI technologies, where it is human and not technology characteristics that shape the human rights framework in the first place. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AU  - De Oliveira Fornasier, M.

AB  - We sought to study the main reflexes of the digital economy that influence legal education, and some of the operational suggestions that accompany criticisms of that process. To this end, some of the main suggestions made by experts in law and education to transform legal education in the face of the technological ubiquity scenario were observed. In a second moment, the transformations that higher education has been undergoing with the introduction of AI in the market and in universities were specifically analyzed. Finally, both the reflexes of AI in legal education and suggestions related to transformations that legal education must undergo were studied. Methodology: The hypothetical-deductive procedure method was used, with a qualitative and technical approach of bibliographic-documentary research, in this exploratory and interdisciplinary research. Results: It was identified that legal education will have to move away from a retrospective epistemological stance, and evolve towards a prospective and projective stance, incorporating knowledge from technological areas and quantitative methodologies, without neglecting the exercise of traditional normative skills, communicative and narrative values that are highly evaluated by law professionals, thus emphasizing the need to foster student creativity. It is also concluded that higher education courses should incorporate coding in their curricula, in parallel with encouraging students' creativity and their communicative skills-however, a regulation should be developed in parallel, which must take into account the ethical risks of the use of AI in teaching. Finally, it is clear that the legal professions are not yet under a very pressing possibility of substitution by AI, but universities must make students aware that there are specific tasks in the legal professions that may be replaced by AI tools in order to advise them to focus on tasks that cannot be replaced by machines. © 2020 Centro Universitario Christus.

TI  - A vulnerability analysis: Theorising the impact of artificial intelligence decision-making processes on individuals, society and human diversity from a social justice perspective
AU  - Krupiy, T.T.
T2  - Computer Law and Security Review
AB  - The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation. © 2020 Tetyana (Tanya) Krupiy

AB  - Career guidance in the era of life-long learning faces challenges related to building accessible services that bridge education and employment services. So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support guidance across higher education and working life. This paper reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance in higher education institutions. Results from focus groups, scenario work and practical trials are presented, mapping requirements and possibilities for using artificial intelligence in career guidance from the viewpoints of students, guidance staff and institutions. The findings indicate potential value and functions as well as drivers and barriers for adopting artificial intelligence in career guidance to support higher education and life-long learning. The authors conceptualize different modes of agency and maturity levels for the involvement of artificial intelligence in guidance processes based on the results. Recommended future research topics in the area of artificially enhanced guidance services include agency in guidance interaction, developing guidance data ecosystem and ethical issues. © 2021, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown, and technologies have intensified across all fields of life, particularly in education. AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates’ skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions. In conclusion, the paper focuses on AI’s applications, benefits and sustainable development education challenges. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Currently, universities are going through a critical moment due to the coronavirus disease in 2019. To prevent its spread, countries have declared quarantines and isolation in all sectors of society. This has caused many problems in the learning of students, since, when moving from a face-to-face educational model to a remote model, several academic factors such as psychological, financial, and methodological have been overlooked. To exactly identify the variables and causes that affect learning, in this work a data analysis model using a Hadoop framework is proposed. By processing the data, it is possible to identify and classify students to determine the problems they present in different learning activities. The results are used by an artificial intelligence system that takes student information and converts it into knowledge, evaluates the academic performance problems they present, and determines what type of activity aligns with the students. The artificial intelligence system processes the information and recommends activities that focus on each student’s abilities and needs. The integration of these systems to universities creates an adaptive educational model that responds to the new challenges of society. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - The Use and Detection of AI-Based Tools in Higher Education
AU  - Lieberman, Gary
T2  - Journal of Instructional Research
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) first made its entry into higher education in the form of paraphrasing tools. These tools were used to take passages that were copied from sources, and through various methods, disguised the original text to avoid academic integrity violations. At first, these tools were not very good and produced nearly incomprehensible output. However, through the use of generative artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the current engines supporting these tools have become better and more efficient at producing quality output. Recently, the artificial intelligence research company, OpenAI, developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence engine to drive a conversational chat frontend application called ChatGPT. Backed by an expansive knowledge base that could rival any university library in volume, this AI-driven conversational application can produce well-written, seemingly academic, responses to questions.

AU  - Landers, Matthew
T2  - Higher Education for the Future
AB  - This article presents a brief overview of the state-of-the-art in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and discusses the difficulties that these technologies create for educators with regard to assessment. Making use of the 'arms race' metaphor, this article argues that there are no simple solutions to the 'AI problem'. Rather, this author shows that educators and universities will need to adopt a complex strategy consisting of solutions at four different levels of vulnerability: Ethical, pedagogic/didactic, technological and policy. Lastly, the article presents general recommendations for addressing vulnerabilities at each of these levels.

AB  - AI chatbots have recently fuelled debate regarding education practices in higher education institutions worldwide. Focusing on Generative AI and ChatGPT in particular, our study examines how AI chatbots impact university teachers' assessment practices, exploring teachers' perceptions about how ChatGPT performs in response to home examination prompts in undergraduate contexts. University teachers (n = 24) from four different departments in humanities and social sciences participated in Turing Test-inspired experiments, where they blindly assessed student and ChatGPT-written responses to home examination questions. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews in focus groups with the same teachers examining their reflections about the quality of the texts they assessed. Regarding chatbot-generated texts, we found a passing rate range across the cohort (37.5-85.7%) and a chatbot-written suspicion range (14-23%).

T2  - Information Systems Education Journal
AB  - In this paper we describe a framework for teaching students when they should, or should not use generative AI such as ChatGPT. Generative AI has created a fundamental shift in how students can complete their class assignments, and other tasks such as building resumes and creating cover letters, and we believe it is imperative that we teach students when the use of generative AI is appropriate, and when it is not appropriate (i.e., considered cheating). Framework development is based off the 2x2 Product-Market matrix introduced by Ansoff in 1965. Our initial pass at the framework was piloted with colleagues, and then followed with a focus group of students to refine the framework. We then used the framework in an MBA class to test its efficacy and gather qualitative feedback. Using the results, we further refined the framework and then used it to teach two general undergraduate business classes as a rudimentary test of generalizability across students.

In our practice as academic developers, we are frequently asked for advice on whether this use for GenAI is reliable, valid, and ethical. Since this is a new field, we have not been able to answer this confidently based on published literature, which depicts both very positive as well as highly cautionary accounts. To fill this gap, we experiment with the use of chatbot style GenAI (namely ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, and Microsoft Copilot) to support or conduct qualitative analysis of survey and interview data from a SoTL project, which had previously been analysed by experienced researchers using thematic analysis.

In broader terms, Palestinian universities follow the traditional methods of teaching based on memorization and rote learning. These conventional teaching strategies are in stark contrast to the manner in which students engage with topics when utilizing ChatGPT. However, the use of ChatGPT has led to a noticeable declining participation in classes, increased absences, and a diminished enthusiasm for examinations–a stark departure from the value they previously placed on them. These patterns suggest that the introduction of ChatGPT is shaping a paradigm shift in education, leading us to question and reevaluate the efficacy and relevance of traditional teaching methods in today's digitized world and the importance of different means of teaching and evaluation

AB  - Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought society closer to the long-held dream of creating machines to help with both common and complex tasks and functions. From recommending movies to detecting disease in its earliest stages, AI has become an aspect of daily life many people accept without scrutiny. Despite its functionality and promise, AI has inherent security risks that users should understand and programmers must be trained to address. The ICE (integrity, confidentiality, and equity) cybersecurity labs developed by a team of cybersecurity researchers addresses these vulnerabilities to AI models through a series of hands-on, inquiry-based labs. Through experimenting with and manipulating data models, students can experience firsthand how adversarial samples and bias can degrade the integrity, confidentiality, and equity of deep learning neural networks, as well as implement security measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

T2  - ELT Journal
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly chatbots with speech-recognition, are gaining attention as tools for ELT. However, this frontline development in contemporary ELT seems to stand in stark contrast to the multilingual effort, another innovative trend, as chatbots' speech recognition capabilities are primarily attuned to native English speaker pronunciation. Addressing this concern, this study adopted a Global Englishes (GE) perspective and examined students' attitudes toward English after their use of a speech-recognition chatbot. Text-mining analysis of reflection papers from 38 students and thematic analysis of interviews with seven students revealed that the chatbot hindered the incorporation of diverse English use into ELT and students expressed a conception of English not as a language in flux but rather as a subject with specific content to be mastered. The findings are discussed concerning GE, AI ethics, and computer-assisted language learning, and implicat

We present the emergent framework, Students' Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students' use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students' use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.

The consequence of this contextual and knowledge gap is a lack of specific understanding regarding students' engagement with ChatGPT for academic dishonesty in Nigerian tertiary institutions. This study addressed these gaps by examining students' perceptions, attitudes, and utilisation of the ChatGPT and determining the role of sex and age in these linkages. A sample of 4679 public university students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling and multigroup analysis were performed to test the conceptual model with the aid of SmartPLS 3. The results indicated that, regardless of sex or age, students with positive perceptions of ChatGPT were more prone to use it for dishonest academic purposes.

AB  - Academic integrity concerns related to students' use of technology have renewed calls for teaching, assessment, and learning best practices, including those that involve and empower students. Empowerment is a benefit of developing students' assessment literacies, or how students contextually understand, plan, and undertake assessment and use assessment information to monitor and progress their learning. Informed by Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory and reflexivity (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1983), a qualitative exploratory case study examined first-year university students' experiences with assessment and the development of their assessment literacies. The findings highlighted student autonomy and empowerment benefits while stressing the importance of reflexivity and assessment literacies for both students and teachers.

Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work.

While incorporating AI into assessment design can streamline the integration of diverse learning components, it is essential to establish clear performance criteria to ensure the validity of these assessments. In engineering education, the integration of AI in assessment design poses ethical concerns, accountability issues, and limitations in capturing diverse learning forms, and therefore careful consideration is required to ensure fairness and pedagogical value are maintained. This paper aims to conceptualise effective assessment processes using AI in engineering education and demonstrate the potential of various validity techniques, providing a comprehensive frame

It explored awareness, use, attitudes, and perceived impact through a survey collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Most participants demonstrated moderate awareness, but little teaching application. Around half had used ChatGPT in some way, but only a minority had used it for educational purposes. Interest was high but many concerns were raised, particularly about student misuse. Most teachers felt they were likely to use it for creating teaching resources but were less open to using it for automated feedback and assessment. Perceptions of the impact of ChatGPT were cautiously optimistic, with more positivity from users with first-hand experience. Concerns focused on misuse, while benefits were noted in terms of efficiency. Qualitative data were analysed using an adapted version of the Concerns-Based Adoption Mod

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into our society. University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a 'black box'. Rather than seeking to explain 'black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a) orienting students to

However, when it comes to grading exams, fully eliminating manual work is not yet possible even with very accurate automated grading, as any grading mistakes could have significant consequences for the students. Here, the evaluation of an automated grading approach is therefore extended from measuring workload in relation to the accuracy of automated grading, to also measuring the overall workload required to correctly grade a full exam, with and without the support of machine learning. The evaluation was performed during an introductory computer science course with over 400 students. The exam consisted of 64 questions with relatively short answers and a two-step approach for automated grading was applied.

AB  - Large Language Models have already begun to affect the higher education landscape. However, there is currently a lack of work investigating how these models interface – and possibly interfere – with literacy development. Considering literacy is critical because student learning is only made possible through language. This paper considers implications for university students' literacy development by drawing on Lea and Street's academic literacies framework. I argue that LLMs pose different levels of risk for students' development of each aspect of literacy contained within the framework: study skills are least at risk, academic socialisation is most at risk, and academic literacies represent an intermediate risk. Implications for instructors include dedicated instructional time and support for students to engage with reading and writing practices without LLM support before they begin to incorporate them into their literacies repertoire. If students rely too heavily on LLMs initially,

T2  - Journal of Educational Technology Systems
AB  - ChatGPT and AI programs are creating a stir on college campuses nationwide. Concerns about cheating are strong and many instructors are adopting new teaching strategies to dissuade students from using the technology in assignments. In the present study, undergraduate students in an introductory epidemiology course were assigned to use ChatGPT to produce essays about topics related to course content and, in pairs, critically analyze the resulting essays. Individually, students responded to reflection questions regarding the technology and its implications for college classrooms. In this study, those qualitative reflection responses were analyzed for themes. While a variety of viewpoints were expressed regarding expectations of the program, most students were aware of the potential for cheating but remained cautiously optimistic about the use of ChatGPT as an educational tool.

AB  - To determine the impacts of using ChatGPT to assist English as a foreign language (EFL) English college majors in revising essays and the possibility of leading to higher scores and potentially causing unfairness. A prospective, double-blinded, paired-comparison study was conducted in Feb. 2023. A total of 44 students provided 44 original essays and 44 ChatGPT-assisted revised essays, which were rated by two independent graders in a randomized and crossover fashion to minimize grading bias. The original and revision scores were paired for before-after comparison. Eight control essays were also rated by both graders to ensure inter-rater reliability. This study used a rigorous experimental design to confirm that ChatGPT-assisted revised essays led to significantly higher scores for EFL college English majors. Significant improvements were observed in all four dimensions of writing quality assessment, with the largest effects observed in vocabulary, followed by grammar, organization, an

T2  - Research Issues in Contemporary Education
AB  - This paper addresses the pedagogical implications of incorporating ChatGPT into the college English classroom specifically and, more broadly, into any college course with a focus on writing and research. Historically, advances in technology in the college classroom have characteristically promoted two juxtaposed reactions: relief and anxiety. Students customarily exhibit relief that a new technology will lessen their workload and embrace it wholeheartedly. Conversely, faculty often experience anxiety at how some newfangled computerized application will impact student learning. This juxtaposition creates barriers to an effective integration of new technology into the classroom. What students view as a cool new tool faculty see as a platform that promotes student slacking or, at worst, cheating. Such is the case with ChatGPT. I review generally the ethics of using ChatGPT as a classroom tool to conclude that the potential for advancing educational equity among students outweighs any pot

Our study aims to find the behavioral motivation behind students' increased use of ChatGPT. Design/methodology/approach: We use PLS-SEM to analyze survey responses from 250 participants in a liberal arts university in the USA. Findings: Students' self-congruency influences their attitude and behavioral intention toward ChatGPT. Students use ChatGPT because they find a higher similarity between their personality and the persona depicted by ChatGPT. So, educators must consider creative assignments that cannot be solved using ChatGPT because any other deterrence will not minimize students' use of ChatGPT.

AB  - The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought both innovative opportunities and unprecedented challenges to the education sector. Although AI makes education more accessible and efficient, the intentional misuse of AI chatbots in facilitating academic cheating has become a growing concern. By using the indirect questioning technique via a list experiment to minimize social desirability bias, this research contributes to the ongoing dialog on academic integrity in the era of AI. Our findings reveal that students conceal AI-powered academic cheating behaviors when directly questioned, as the prevalence of cheaters observed via list experiments is almost threefold the prevalence of cheaters observed via the basic direct questioning approach. Interestingly, our subsample analysis shows that AI-powered academic cheating behaviors differ significantly across genders and grades, as higher-grade female students are more likely to cheat than newly enrolled female stu

AB  - Purpose: In November 2022, the commercial company, OpenAI, launched ChatGPT. Since then, university students have rapidly become regular users of this artificial intelligence (AI) platform. One reason for this is the powerful capability of this generative AI tool to produce textual content, which in many cases, is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. Another reason is that ChatGPT easily gives anyone access to knowledge. However, there is a problem as the vast majority of its users have no idea how this AI platform works and thus overlook the importance of thinking critically about information communicated in ChatGPT. While some call for banning this generative AI tool, this study aims to provide evidence that science classrooms can become scenarios where students find explicit, concrete, and realistic opportunities to critically evaluate scientific information generated by ChatGPT.

We provide a conceptual framework mapping nine Gen-AI objectives to the principles of andragogy. A semester-long course example illustrates this framework in action through AI activities fostering autonomy, competence, and real-world application. Student surveys revealed overwhelmingly positive perceptions of Gen-AI integration and improved exam scores. However, dependence risks remain. The essay discusses strategies to enhance critical thinking, personal growth, and academic integrity.

AB  - Our world has been transformed by technologies incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) within mass communication, employment, entertainment and many other aspects of our daily lives. However, within the domain of education, it seems that our ways of working and, particularly, assessing have hardly changed at all. We continue to prize examinations and summative testing as the most reliable way to assess educational achievements, and we continue to rely on paper-based test delivery as our modus operandi. Inertia, tradition and aversion to perceived risk have resulted in a lack of innovation (James, 2006), particularly so in the area of high-stakes assessment. The summer of 2020 brought this deficit into very sharp focus with the A-level debacle in England, where grades were awarded, challenged, rescinded and reset. These events are potentially catastrophic in terms of how we trust national examinations, and the problems arise from using just one way to define academic success and one

T2  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, so does the interest in AI ethics. To address issues related to AI ethics, many government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and corporations have published AI ethics guidelines. However, only a few test instruments have been developed to assess students' attitudes toward AI ethics. A related instrument is required to effectively prepare lecture curricula and materials on AI ethics, as well as to quantitatively evaluate the learning effect of students. In this study, we developed and validated the instrument (AT-EAI) to assess undergraduate students' attitudes toward AI ethics. The instrument's reliability, content validity, and construct validity were evaluated following its development and application in a sample of 1,076 undergraduate students. Initially, the instrument comprised five dimensions that totaled 42 items, while the final version had 17 items. When it came to content validity, experts (n = 8) were in

AB  - 18 students engaged in learning about artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT 3 (CHAT), to respond to the question of whether it is ethical or practical for students to use CHAT in college-level classrooms to complete assignments. A thematic unit was created and taught in 2 face-to-face English 101 classes to explore the topic of CHAT. The unit was created with and designed to be completed by CHAT. After reflecting on 3 readings, 2 videos, and completing various related assignments, students were expected to write a 5-page essay about CHAT using CHAT in whatever way they wanted to complete the work while still maintaining the specific requirements of the English 101 objectives. The essays were examined by the students using the same peer review process that we used for 2 essays written without using CHAT before the thematic unit, with the addition of 2 instructions: to check the veracity of the sources, and to evaluate the essays for consistency of tone, accuracy of information,

AB  - In the evolving landscape of higher education, challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the necessity for innovative teaching methodologies. These challenges have catalyzed the integration of technology into education, particularly in blended learning environments, to bolster self-regulated learning (SRL) and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, increased autonomy in blended learning can lead to learning disruptions if issues are not promptly addressed. In this context, OpenAI's ChatGPT, known for its extensive knowledge base and immediate feedback capability, emerges as a significant educational resource. Nonetheless, there are concerns that students might become excessively dependent on such tools, potentially hindering their development of HOTS. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Guidance-based ChatGPT-assisted Learning Aid (GCLA).

Claims of the potential impact on education are contested, but there are clear risks of inappropriate use particularly where GenAI aligns poorly with learning aims. In response, in mid-2023, the Australian Federal Government held an inquiry, calling for public submissions. This inquiry offers a lens onto the policy framing of GenAI in education and provides the object of investigation for this paper. We use the inquiry submissions, extracting structured claims from each. This extraction is provided as an open data set for further research, while this paper focuses on our analysis of the policy recommendations made.

AB  - Teacher-student interaction (TSI) is essential for learning efficiency and harmonious teacher-student interpersonal relationships. However, studies on TSI support tools often focus on teacher needs while neglecting student needs and autonomy. To enhance both lecturer competence in delivering interpersonal interaction and student autonomy in TSI, we developed NaMemo2, a novel augmented-reality system that allows students to express their willingness to TSI and displays student information to teachers during lectures. The design and evaluation process follows a new framework, STUDIER, which can facilitate the development of theory-based ethnics-aware TSI support tools in general. The quantitative results of our four-week field study with four classes in a university suggested that NaMemo2 can improve (1) TSI in the classroom from both teacher and student perspectives, (2) student attitudes and willingness to TSI, and (3) student attitudes to the deployment of NaMemo2.

AB  - Career guidance in the era of life-long learning faces challenges related to building accessible services that bridge education and employment services. So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support guidance across higher education and working life. This paper reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance in higher education institutions. Results from focus groups, scenario work and practical trials are presented, mapping requirements and possibilities for using artificial intelligence in career guidance from the viewpoints of students, guidance staff and institutions. The findings indicate potential value and functions as well as drivers and barriers for adopting artificial intelligence in career guidance to support higher education and life-long learning.

AB  - Large language models such as ChatGPT can be seen as a major threat to reliable assessment in higher education. In this point of departure, I argue that these tools are a major game changer for society at large. Many of the jobs we now consider highly skilled are based on pattern recognition that can much more reliably be carried by fine-tuned language models. We are therefore at a turning point in history and it affords a powerful opportunity to reconsider the value of higher education in the light of these tools.

AB  - Background: Academic integrity (AI) is of increasing importance in higher education. At the same time, students are becoming more consumer-oriented and more inclined to appeal against, or complain about, a penalty imposed for a breach of AI. This combination of factors places pressure on institutions of higher education to handle alleged breaches of AI in a way acceptable to students that motivates them to continue to engage with their studies. Method: Students (n = 8) were interviewed to discover their perceptions of the process for dealing with breaches of AI. All students were based in one university in a very diverse area of London which has many first-generation students from non-traditional academic backgrounds. Results: Students reported strong emotional reactions featuring high levels of anxiety and stress. Some found the process to be threatening and demotivating and questioned continuation on their course of study, while others used more adaptive coping strategies. Students

This study adopted literature meta-analysis, along with the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods in order to establish the risk framework and calculate the index weight of HCAI education. The results confirm that the risk framework includes eight indicators, which respectively are misunderstanding of the HCAI concept (MC), misuse of AI resources (MR), mismatching of AI pedagogy (MP), privacy security risk (PSR), transparency risk (TR), accountability risk (AR), bias risk (BR), and perceived risk (PR). Meanwhile, the eight indicators are divided into four categories such as HCAI concept, application process, ethical security, and man-machine interaction. Moreover, the trend of ris

Using reflection papers and focus group interviews, the qualitative study examined doctoral students' views on the impact of using ChatGPT on L2 writing and their expected responses. Thematic analysis revealed that ChatGPT could support writers at the pre-writing, during-writing and post-writing stages and serve as a self-learning tool for writing and thinking development with its human and non-human features. Nonetheless, its generative nature also gave rise to concerns for learning loss, authorial voice, unintelligent texts, academic integrity as well as social and safety risks. Based on the benefits and drawbacks, the doctoral students expected the education sector to make concerted efforts for the effective, ethical and responsible use of ChatGPT in L2 writing.

In this article, I look at the practicalities of AI in education and at the attendant ethical issues it raises. My key conclusion is that AI in the near- to medium-term future has the potential to enrich student learning and complement the work of (human) teachers without dispensing with them. In addition, AI should increasingly enable such traditional divides as 'school versus home' to be straddled with regard to learning. AI offers the hope of increasing personalization in education, but it is accompanied by risks of learning becoming less social. There is much that we can learn from previous introductions of new technologies in school to help maximize the likelihood tha

An IDSA further can guide students through HEI and their administration. But, what are the critical success factors (CSF) and challenges for an IDSA? We deduce these using a mixed methods approach with one quantitative student survey, two rounds of interviews with various HEI experts, and a literature review. We classified our results according to the information system (IS) success model of DeLone &amp; McLean (2016).

Distributed learning institutions face specific challenges such as high levels of student attrition and ensuring quality, cost-effective student support at scale using a range of technologies, such as AI. While there is an expanding body of research on AI in education (AIEd), this conceptual article proposes that combinations of human-algorithmic decision-making systems need careful and critical consideration, not only for their potential, but also for their appropriateness and ethical considerations. We operationalize a framework designed to consider robot autonomy at four key events in students' learning journeys, namely (1) admission and registration; (2) student advising and support; (3) augmenting pedagogy; and (4) formative and summative assessment.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has evolved since its inception in the 1950s, resulting in the creation of large language models that are trained on extensive data sets to understand and generate content, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. Modern technology that is easy to access and free to use, like ChatGPT, is changing the educational landscape as it is an example of a large language model – an artificial intelligence network – that can process and generate text that reads as though it were written by a person. Using a survey and semi-structured interviews, this exploratory mixed-method study examined social work educators' experiences of addressing students' use of ChatGPT and found that although they are uncomfortable with addressing ChatGPT use with their students, they believe it is necessary to communicate its ethical use to them. Results also suggested that while using ChatGPT as a learning tool is valid, it can be overused. ChatGPT use gives students a fals

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to predict students' performance in an introductory physics class. The prediction model classified students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a grade of C, D, F or withdraw from the class. Early prediction could better allow the direction of educational interventions and the allocation of educational resources. However, the performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B, or C (the ABC outcome) or if they would receive a D, F or withdraw (W) from the class (the DFW outcome) because the outcome is substantially unbalanced with between 10% to 20% of the students receiving a D, F, or W. This work presents techniques to adjust the prediction models and alternate model performance metrics more appropriate for unbalanced outcome variables.

T2  - Journal of Computing in Higher Education
AB  - Automated text detection and analysis holds incredible potential for research in higher education. It is challenging because higher education institutes produce an enormous amount and variety of texts, letters, articles, books, reports etc. Futuristic E-learning based education replaces the difficulty of understanding the semantic meaning of the learning content from videos which is most prominent source used by the leaners to acquire knowledge. Therefore, Content Based Video retrieval has become the challenging research area under pattern recognition and computer vision in higher education through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Text plays a dynamic role in understanding the true meaning of behavior of the video. Hence, it is challenging to detect and identify the text in video due to variable complex background, low contrast, blur, poor illumination, font size, font-style, occlusions. The traditional approach of end-to-end convolution neural network (CNN) performs satisfactory

AB  - With the advent of physiological computing systems, new avenues are emerging for the field of learning analytics related to the potential integration of physiological data. To this end, we developed a physiological computing infrastructure to collect physiological data, surveys, and browsing behavior data to capture students' learning journey in remote learning. Specifically, our solution is based on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer and Polar H10 chest belt. In this work-in-progress paper, we present preliminary results and experiences we collected from a field study with medical students using our developed infrastructure. Our results do not only provide a new direction for more effectively capturing different types of data in remote learning by addressing the underlying challenges of remote setups, but also serve as a foundation for future work on developing a less obtrusive, (near) real-time measurement method based on the classification of cognitive-affective states such as flow or o

AB  - Collaborative design approaches have been increasingly adopted in the design of learning technologies since they contribute to develop pedagogically inclusive and appropriate learning designs. Despite the positive reception of collaborative design strategies in technology-enhanced learning, little attention has been dedicated to analyzing the challenges faced in design processes using a collaborative approach. In this paper, we disclose the collaborative design of a chatbot for self-regulated learning in higher education using an action research approach. We analyze the design process of EDUguia chatbot, which includes diverse evidence from questionnaires and workshops with students and lecturers, as well as intermediary design objects. Based on the qualitative analysis, we identify several challenges that are transversal to the co-design work, as well as specific to the design phases.

AU  - Martin, Joshua L.

T2  - Applied Linguistics
AB  - Research on bias in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in recent years, especially around racial bias. Many modern technologies which impact people's lives have been shown to have significant racial biases, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Emerging studies have found that widely-used ASR systems function much more poorly on the speech of Black people. Yet, this work is limited because it lacks a deeper consideration of the sociolinguistic literature on African American Language (AAL). In this paper, then, we seek to integrate AAL research into these endeavors to analyze ways in which ASRs might be biased against the linguistic features of AAL and how the use of biased ASRs could prove harmful to speakers of AAL. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the ways in which AAL has been discriminated against in the workforce and healthcare in the past, and (2) explore how introducing biased ASRs in these areas could perpetuate or even deepen linguistic

Increased adoption of this technology can be attributed to its ability of processing enormous amounts of data promptly in addressing specific queries and producing customized intelligent recommendations. While CC's transformative technologies offer profound benefits to the healthcare industry, it also carries an unpredictable burden of risk and mistakes with damaging consequences to patients. At this juncture, CC's legal place in healthcare is largely undefined as the applicable liability framework is ambiguous.

The study was conducted over 3 years at a large Australian university, and findings demonstrate that familiarity with the system over time improved student attitudes towards remote invigilation. Positive experiences were found to be related to ease of use and convenience for test sitting. The majority of students reported that it was important for the institution to have approaches such as remote invigilation to discourage cheating and they believed that the system was useful in this regard. Perceived technical problems were found to invoke feelings of anxiety with being remotely invigilated, and students suggested that greater clarity on expectations of appropriate behaviour, privacy and data security would help alleviate discomfort and improve the system.

T2  - Educational Technology &amp; Society
AB  - In traditional instruction, teachers generally deliver the content of textbooks to students via lectures, making teaching activities lack vibrancy. Moreover, in such a one-to-many teaching mode, the teacher is usually unable to check on individual students' learning status or to provide immediate feedback to resolve their learning problems. Chatbots provide an opportunity to address this problem. However, conventional chatbots generally serve as information providers (i.e., providing relevant information by matching keywords in a conversation) rather than as decision-making advisors (i.e., using a knowledge-base with a decision-making mechanism to help users solve problems). Thus, this study proposes an expert decision-making-based chatbot to facilitate individual students' construction of knowledge during the learning process. A quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the differences in the performances and perceptions of students using the expert decision-making-based chatbot (EDM

AB  - Considering the widespread belief in the potential of mobile technology to enhance core activities of teachers, like lesson planning and preparation, limited research has been conducted on the use of mobile technology to support these activities. To address this research gap, this study delved into the acceptance of an intent-based chatbot specifically designed to aid preservice teachers (n = 92) during planning tasks. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), findings indicate that Perceived Usefulness was a significant predictor of Chatbot Use, while the role of Ease of Use was more nuanced. Qualitative data analysis provided valuable insights into the factors that influence chatbot adoption or nonadoption, allowing for a contextualized understanding within the TAM framework.

TI  - Faculty Perspectives on Mis- and Disinformation across Disciplines
AU  - Saunders, Laura
T2  - College &amp; Research Libraries
AB  - Librarians, who have long promoted the criticality of information literacy, were quick to identify a role for themselves in confronting the challenges of mis/disinformation through library instruction. Nevertheless, little research has been done to examine discipline faculty's perspectives on mis/disinformation or the extent to which they are addressing the issue in their classrooms. This paper begins to address this gap in the literature through a nationwide study and follow-up interviews of faculty across disciplines to probe their perspectives on the challenges of mis/disinformation. Participants were asked about their views on mis/disinformation, whether and how they address mis/disinformation in their courses, and their perceptions of their students' ability to identify and evaluate mis/disinformation. The findings of this study have implications for academic librarians, especially liaison librarians with instructional responsibilities, and may be of interest to academic library

AB  - Help-seeking is a valuable practice in online discussion forums. However, the asynchronicity and information overload of online discussion forums have made it challenging for help seekers and providers to connect effectively. This study formulated a new method to provide fair and accurate insights toward building a peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning. Specifically, we developed the fair network embedding (Fair-NE) model and compared it with existing popular models. We trained and evaluated the models with a large dataset consisting of 187,450 discussion post-reply pairs by 10,182 Algebra I online learners from 2015 to 2020. Finally, we examined models with representation fairness, predictive accuracy, and predictive fairness. The results showed that the Fair-NE can achieve superior fairness in genders and races while retaining competitive predictive accuracy.

T2  - European Journal of Engineering Education
AB  - Authentic writing is an important aspect in education and research. Unfortunately, academic misconduct occurs among students and researchers. Consequently, written articles undergo certain detection measures and most teaching and research institutions use a range of software to detect plagiarism. However, state-of-the-art Automatic Article Generator (AAG) writing powered by Artificial Intelligence provides a new platform for new types of serious academic misconduct that cannot be easily detected and even if they are detected, can be hard to prove. The main objective of this study is to raise awareness of these tools among academics. This paper first explains the features of AAG writing, then investigates whether academics can distinguish AAG writing from human writing and whether raising the awareness of AAG between academics can improve their ability to detect AAG writing. A case study showed how difficult it is for academics with no knowledge of AAGs to identify this writing. A surv

AB  - Student evaluation surveys provide educational institutions with important feedback regarding the student experience of teaching and courses; however, qualitative comments can contain offensive, insulting or threatening content. Large educational institutions generate thousands of comments per academic term; therefore, manual screening processes to find potentially harmful comments are not generally feasible. We developed a methodology for semi-automated screening of student comments that incorporates a machine learning decision support system and a detailed psychological assessment protocol. In a case study at a large public Australian university, our system identified 4,258 out of 62,049 (6.9%) comments as potentially harmful and requiring further review. Feedback from stakeholders demonstrates that this methodology is useful in reducing staff workload and could be broadly applied to different settings.

AB  - Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks, performance predictions based on student scores are generally made, but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study, performances of 3518 university students, who studying and actively participating in a learning management system, were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender, content score, time spent on the content, number of entries to content, homework score, number of attendance to live sessions, total time spent in live sessions, number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables.

By literature analysis, this paper points out the challenges faced by adaptive learning research, such as the lack of cognition of brain and technology, the bottleneck of the model of emotion domain, the separation of education and technology, the security of data management and the risk of privacy leakage. These challenges can be summarized into two aspects: one is mechanical issues, the other is safety issues. Different from traditional research perspectives, the paper opens a new research window, and puts forward countermeasures from the perspectives of cognitive principles, zone of proximal development theory in technology, breakthrough in the emotional domain model, learning data management

AB  - Use of university students' educational data for learning analytics has spurred a debate about whether and how to provide students with agency regarding data collection and use. A concern is that students opting out of learning analytics may skew predictive models, in particular if certain student populations disproportionately opt out and biases are unintentionally introduced into predictive models. We investigated university students' propensity to consent to learning analytics through an email prompt, and collected respondents' perceived benefits and privacy concerns regarding learning analytics in a subsequent online survey. In particular, we studied whether and why students' consent propensity differs among student subpopulations by sending our email prompt to a sample of 4,000 students at our institution stratified by ethnicity and gender. 272 students interacted with the email, of which 119 also completed the survey.

AB  - Data collection and analysis is nothing new in computer-assisted language learning, but with the phenomenon of massive sets of human language collected into corpora, and especially integrated into systems driven by artificial intelligence, new opportunities have arisen for language teaching and learning. We are now seeing powerful artificial neural networks with impressive language capabilities. In education, data provides means to track learner performance and improve learning, especially through the application of data mining to expose hidden patterns of learner behavior. Massive data collection also raises issues of transparency and fairness. Human monitoring is essential in applying data analysis equitably. Big data may have as powerful an impact in language learning as it is having in society generally; it is an important resource to have available, but one to use with care and caution.

AB  - Spatial computing is the fourth paradigm of the digital revolution and could profoundly transform learning. It is the convergence of several technological developments, including Augmented and Virtual Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence, haptic feedback, motion-capture, and situational awareness engines. This article explores how the shift from 2D screens to virtual worlds will impact learning and raise new ethical and digital literacy challenges. Spatial computing goes far beyond the simple use of a VR headset for virtual experiences. Microsoft's experimental Dreamwalker project has already demonstrated how a user can remain entirely immersed in a virtual environment while successfully navigating the real world around them. These developments offer far-reaching implications for learning and our social interactions.

T2  - Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education
AB  - Contract cheating happens when students outsource their assessed work to a third party. One approach that has been suggested for improving contract cheating detection is comparing students' assignment submissions with their previous work, the rationale being that changes in style may indicate a piece of work has been written by somebody else. This approach is time consuming, but recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing suggest that it may be well suited to computerization. We trialed an early alpha version of Turnitin's Authorship Investigate tool, which compares students' submissions against their previous work. Twenty-four experienced markers from five units of study were asked to make decisions about the presence of contract cheating in bundles of 20 student assignments, which included 14 legitimate assignments and six purchased from contract cheating sites.
