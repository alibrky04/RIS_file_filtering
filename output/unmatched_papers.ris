T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into education, specifically through generative chatbots, can transform teaching and learning for education professionals in both administrative and pedagogical ways. However, the ethical implications of using generative chatbots in education must be carefully considered. Ethical concerns about advanced chatbots have yet to be explored in the education sector. This short article introduces the ethical concerns associated with introducing platforms such as ChatGPT in education. The article outlines how handling sensitive student data by chatbots presents significant privacy challenges, thus requiring adherence to data protection regulations, which may not always be possible. It highlights the risk of algorithmic bias in chatbots, which could perpetuate societal biases, which can be problematic. The article also examines the balance between fostering student autonomy in learning and the potential impact on academic self-efficacy, noting the risk of over-reliance on AI for educational purposes. Plagiarism continues to emerge as a critical ethical concern, with AI-generated content threatening academic integrity. The article advocates for comprehensive measures to address these ethical issues, including clear policies, advanced plagiarism detection techniques, and innovative assessment methods. By addressing these ethical challenges, the article argues that educators, AI developers, policymakers, and students can fully harness the potential of chatbots in education, creating a more inclusive, empowering, and ethically sound educational future.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study explores the role of perceived utility, social influence, and ethical concerns in the adoption of AI-based data analysis tools among academic researchers in China, focusing on differences between public and private universities. The research aims to identify key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of AI technology in academic settings. A quantitative approach was employed, using a multi-group structural equation model (SEM) analysis to assess data collected from 750 academic researchers across various disciplines (N-pvt = 402; N-pub = 348). The findings reveal that both perceived utility and social influence significantly influence the adoption of AI tools. Higher perceived utility and stronger social influence lead to greater adoption. However, ethical concerns were found to moderate these relationships, particularly in public universities, where researchers with high ethical concerns perceived greater risks, thereby reducing their likelihood of adoption. In contrast, private university researchers showed a higher tolerance for perceived risks when utility and social influence were evident. The study's implications suggest that to promote AI adoption, institutions must address ethical concerns and perceived risks, particularly in public universities, by enhancing transparency, providing ethical guidelines, and offering comprehensive training. These efforts can lead to more effective integration of AI technologies, ultimately enhancing research productivity and innovation across diverse academic environments.

T2  - OPEN PRAXIS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online assessment, prompting debates over validity, security, and increasingly the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, especially generative AI, on traditional examination methods. This paper explores perceptions of the evolving landscape of online assessment and the role of AI within higher education, building on work conducted at the University of London and the Open University UK. Workshops used speculative methods to envision potential future scenarios and gather perspectives. These revealed a complex, ambivalent outlook on online assessment and AI's role in education. The paper highlights the polarised views surrounding AI, ranging from ethical concerns about academic integrity and unfair advantages to opportunities for enhancing learning and inclusivity in assessment practices. Our findings reflect attitudes of students and educators towards AI and online assessment, identifying key themes such as ethics and integrity, the need for redesigning assessments, issues of diversity and inclusion, and the dependencies required for successful integration of AI. Participants highlighted both the potential benefits of AI in creating more authentic and personalised assessment experiences and the risks of exacerbating inequalities and undermining institutional credibility. The paper underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach to AI and online assessment in educational policy and practice, emphasising inclusive, ethical, and innovative approaches to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these technological disruptors.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools hold significant promises for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. However, continues usage behavior and satisfaction of educators with GenAI systems are still less explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors influencing academic staff satisfaction and continuous GenAI usage in higher education, employing a survey method and analyzing data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This research utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) as its theoretical foundations, while also integrating ethical concerns as a significant factor. Data was collected from a sample of 127 university academic staff through an online survey questionnaire. The study found a positive correlation between effort expectancy, ethical consideration, expectation confirmation, and academic staff satisfaction. However, performance expectancy did not show a positive correlation with satisfaction. Performance expectancy was positively related to the intention to use GenAI tools, while academic staff satisfaction positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The social influence did not correlate positively with the use of GenAI. Security and privacy were positively associated with staff satisfaction. Facilitation conditions also positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for academia and policymakers, guiding the responsible integration of GenAI tools in education while emphasizing factors for policy considerations and developers of GenAI tools.

T2  - RELIEVE-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y EVALUACION EDUCATIVA
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized the field of higher education, and sparked debates on the potential of tools such as ChatGPT, Humata.ai or Sudowrite in teaching, learning and assessment processes. While their integration in this context offers numerous opportunities ( e.g., instant feedback, generation of resources and teaching materials, adaptive learning, interactivity, etc.), it also poses significant challenges that raise ethical and academic integrity concerns, such as the reliability of information, transparency regarding the sources used, or data privacy and security. The aim of this article is to examine the ethical implications of GAI in higher education from a three-fold perspective (students, faculty, and institutions). Additionally, it aims to analyze its impact on aspects related to security, accessibility, sustainability and even new forms of plagiarism and academic fraud that involve impersonation of authorship. Based on the literature review conducted, and in accordance with the ideas proposed by some authors, possibilities for integrating GAI into university classrooms will be explored. This will be achieved through pedagogical practices that guide students in the proper use of GAI and enable faculty to seek new educational approaches. This transformation process will require the establishment of clear guidelines that align with ethical codes and integrity policies of higher education institutions. Ultimately, the reflection on how to combine education, innovation, and academic integrity will provide these three groups with a new opportunity to drive improvements in university education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB  - The growing incidence of academic dishonesty (AD) involving students using commercial essay writing services (essay mills) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) risks the credibility of assessment approaches within higher education (HE) worldwide. Reflecting on experience from a UK business school, the article explores the potential for novel assessment design and feedback to reduce the prevalence of AD. Speculating on success and failure rates of students undertaking formal assessment, the article evaluates the broader ethical implications for universities in recruitment and learner support, particularly within contemporary discourses on international student attainment, mental health, and well-being.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - An open access article under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more widely used in higher education, we must pay attention to the risks that can emerge. AI projects, whether applied in classroom learning or used for decision-making regarding admissions, financial aid allocation, or hiring, must include attention to governance and compliance issues, regardless of the project's scope and scale. Concerns highlighted in this work include transparency, user privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability, however, we note that this is a non-exhaustive list of risks. In this paper, risk assessment is defined, and two examples of risk management frameworks, namely the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework and the non-profit humanitarian effort ForHumanity's Independent Audit of AI, Algorithmic, and Autonomous Systems are briefly described. We identify characteristics of AI applications that need to be assessed for vulnerabilities they may present, such as bias and discrimination. This paper aims to facilitate discussion among stakeholders about the risks that may be encountered from using AI in higher education, as well as to suggest ways developers, decision-makers, and users can mitigate these risks. Much discussion and published literature has focused on risk management frameworks designed for large organizations or enterprises or frameworks that do not consider risks specific to AI. We hope that decision-makers carefully consider the risks, perform due diligence when implementing AI applications, and create a plan for mitigating the risks. This research supports e-learning practice because students and faculty are embracing AI applications. Leaders and decision-makers in higher education need to be proactive in protecting their varied stakeholders. The paper asks what risks may be encountered by institutions of higher education when using AI tools and products in the classroom and for various aspects of decision-making and if published frameworks can mitigate these risks.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine the development and implementation of the INSPIRE (Integrating New Strategies for Performance in Inclusive and Reflective Education) framework within a university's Science Faculty across various instructional modalities to enhance student outcomes and uphold assessment integrity.Design/methodology/approachThis action research-informed case study evaluated the effectiveness of INSPIRE in reducing failure and improving student engagement by comparing two instructional periods: the pre-INSPIRE phase, with traditional teaching methods, high failure rates and limited support, and the INSPIRE-driven phase, which introduced adaptive assessments, AI-enhanced learning tools and inclusive education strategies. Data from student performance records, faculty reports and student surveys were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach to assess changes across departments and instructional modalities. Institutional reports, including examiners' meeting minutes and academic board discussions, were examined alongside semistructured interviews with faculty and students to triangulate findings and identify implementation challenges.FindingsINSPIRE led to a 4.5-fold reduction in high-failure courses, significant improvements in student engagement, assessment integrity and equity-driven support mechanisms. Online and hybrid learning environments exhibited the most substantial gains, benefiting from adaptive assessments and AI-powered learning tools, while face-to-face instruction required further enhancements in active learning methodologies.Originality/valueThis study advances discourse on evidence-based educational reforms, demonstrating the potential of structured, iterative interventions to transform student learning. INSPIRE serves as a scalable model for institutions seeking to enhance student success.

AB  - Integrating generative AI (GAI) into higher education is crucial for preparing a future generation of GAI-literate students. However, a comprehensive understanding of global institutional adoption policies remains absent, with most prior studies focusing on the Global North and lacking a theoretical lens. This study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to examine GAI adoption strategies in higher education across 40 universities from six global regions. It explores the characteristics of GAI innovation, including compatibility, trialability, and observability, and analyses the communication channels and roles and responsibilities outlined in university policies and guidelines. The findings reveal that universities are proactively addressing GAI integration by emphasising academic integrity, enhancing teaching and learning practices, and promoting equity. Key policy measures include the development of guidelines for ethical GAI use, the design of authentic assessments to mitigate misuse, and the provision of training programs for faculty and students to foster GAI literacy. Despite these efforts, gaps remain in comprehensive policy frameworks, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns and ensuring equitable access to GAI tools. The study underscores the importance of clear communication channels, stakeholder collaboration, and ongoing evaluation to support effective GAI adoption. These insights provide actionable insights for policymakers to craft inclusive, transparent, and adaptive strategies for integrating GAI into higher education. © 2024 The Authors

AU  - Combrinck, C.

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Written assignments for large classes pose a far more significant challenge in the age of the GenAI revolution. Suggestions such as oral exams and formative assessments are not always feasible with many students in a class. Therefore, we conducted a study in South Africa and involved 280 Honors students to explore the usefulness of Turnitin's AI detector in conjunction with student self-reflection. Using a Mixed Methods Research (MMR) approach, we analysed data generated from the Turnitin AI reports, our grading rubrics, and qualitative student self-reflection. The findings show that incorporating self-reflection into assessments supports ethical GenAI use and improves the transparency lecturers need for decision-making. A declaration form allowed the students to be upfront about using Generative Artificial Intelligence tools. We found that students who can reflect on their learning relied less on generated content. However, students with high AI detected scores (> 20%) did not adequately reflect on how the tools supported their learning and could not give credible explanations of use. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing students and academics with examples of responsibly handling AI-detected scores in large-class settings. We present a guided self-reflection and declaration with an AI detector to support students and help lecturers make decisions when grading. We also present a decision tree that lecturers and graders can use when evaluating AI use in assessments. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The rise of AI in higher education offers significant opportunities for streamlining learning outcomes, operational efficiency, and even institutional progress. Besides personalized learning systems, the adoption of AI should integrate these ethical, and sometimes even legal, frameworks. The student's engagement and academic performance can be best improved with adaptive learning technologies and predictive analytics. Also, included in the study are; identification and exploration of limits, such as challenges faced by emerging technologies, meaning that students need to be cautious. Data breaches, biases in algorithms, scarce resources, and resistance to change will work as unique obstacles; hence, suggestions presented will be quite specific to each of these themes. Higher education will undergo transformative changes, traversing from inclusivity and innovation through the mechanisms of stronger governance, capacity building, and international cooperation; with AI, such pathways are possible. Such discoveries underscore the importance of developing interdisciplinary research capable of generating both transparent and effective frameworks. This would ensure that the longer-term impact of AI utilization is harmonized with educational and societal targets. © 2025, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the risks affecting digital transformation in higher education institutions in Kazakhstan through a multi-method research approach. The investigation integrates quantitative surveys (N=4,971 students), qualitative focus groups (N=100 faculty and administrators), and expert evaluations using PEST analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of transformation challenges. Key findings revealed that scientific and technical factors emerged as the most significant risk drivers (x? = 8.25), followed by economic constraints (x? = 7.62) and organizational readiness barriers (x?= 6.71). Survey results indicated that while 64.4% of students perceived digital technologies as beneficial for learning, 47.8% reported difficulties with digital platform usage. Focus group interviews highlighted critical challenges in three domains: infrastructure limitations (cited by 68% of faculty), pedagogical adaptation needs (noted by 72%), and ethical implications of AI integration (expressed by 85%). The PEST analysis identified technological factors as primary risk drivers, with rapid platform adoption and data security concerns ranked highest. The study advances a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating both internal and external risks in digital transformation, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions, organizational development strategies, and enhanced institutional readiness measures. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and institutional leaders implementing digital transformation initiatives in emerging educational contexts. © 2025 Fırtına Akademi A.Ş.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Most higher education institutions employ study advisors to support their students. To adequately perform their task, study advisors have access to study information about their students. Using AI techniques to analyze that information and to predict if a student might be at risk of study delay could be a valuable tool in study advisors' practice. In this paper, we present a use case of how such a tool was developed (in the form of a dashboard) and which steps and considerations played a role in the responsible deployment of the tool. Three aspects are described: first, we present the timeline of the case study and zoom in on how the macro-level of the institution (where the groundwork is laid to facilitate AI-systems in education) and the micro-level of the implementation of the system influenced each other. Second, we describe which stakeholders were involved and what their ethical considerations were concerning data management, algorithms, and pedagogy. Third, we describe the initial evaluation of the dashboard in terms of study advisors’ experiences and provide suggestions on how to stimulate the responsible and useful implementation of a predictive modelling tool. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The growing use of generative AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) calls the sustainability of traditional assessment practices into question. Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate eloquent essays on any topic and in any language, write code in various programming languages, and ace most standardized tests, all within seconds. We conducted an international survey of educators and students in higher education to understand and compare their perspectives on the impact of generative AI across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Across three universities, 680 students and 87 educators, who moderately use generative AI, consider essay and coding assessments to be most impacted. Educators strongly prefer assessments that are adapted to assume the use of AI and encourage critical thinking, while students' reactions are mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, alongside higher-order thinking and authentic applications. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on students' learning experiences and perceptions through a master’s-level course. The study specifically focused on student engagement, comfort with GenAI and ethical considerations. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an action research methodology employing qualitative data collection methods, including pre- and post-course surveys, reflective assignments, class discussions and a questionnaire. The AI-Ideas, Connections, Extensions (ICE) Framework, combining the ICE Model and AI paradigms, is used to assess students' cognitive engagement with GenAI. Findings: The study revealed that incorporating GenAI in a master’s-level instructional design course increased students' comfort with GenAI and their understanding of its ethical implications. The AI-ICE Framework demonstrated most students were at the initial engagement level, with growing awareness of GenAI’s limitations and ethical issues. Course reflections highlighted themes of improved teaching strategies, personal growth and the practical challenges of integrating GenAI responsibly. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size poses challenges to the analytical power of the findings, potentially limiting the breadth and applicability of conclusions. This constraint may affect the generalizability of the results, as the participants may not fully represent the broader population of interest. The researchers are mindful of these limitations and suggest caution in interpreting the findings, acknowledging that they may offer more exploratory insights than definitive conclusions. Future research endeavors should aim to recruit a larger cohort to validate and expand upon the initial observations, ensuring a more robust understanding. Originality/value: The study is original in its integration of GenAI into a master's-level instructional design course, assessing both the practical and ethical implications of its use in education. By utilizing the AI-ICE Framework to evaluate students' cognitive engagement and employing action research methodology, the study provides insights into how GenAI influences learning experiences and perceptions. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and the real-world application of GenAI, offering actionable strategies for its responsible use in educational settings. © 2024, Dwayne Wood and Scott H.

T2  - IAFOR Journal of Education
AB  - In the context of education, the issues of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching and maintaining academic integrity in students’ use of AI are particularly relevant. This paper empirically examined the issue of ChatGPT usage for writing homework from the perspectives of students and professors. Study research methods included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In Study 1, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 350 Croatian students, users of ChatGPT, to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, habits, and intentions regarding ChatGPT usage for homework assignments. In Study 2, twelve faculty members were tested on their accuracy of distinguishing between original students’ papers and ChatGPT-generated papers. For this purpose, 25 different versions of papers for 8 different courses were prepared. The results of the students’ survey showed that most students still do not use ChatGPT regularly and have neutral attitudes about its usefulness, ease of use, risks, and intentions for future use. In addition, they were moderately concerned about ethical issues around its usage. Differences across gender and field of study were found. Professors, on the other hand, reported having average self-efficacy in appraising authorship, which is in line with their low average accuracy of 53%. Accuracy in distinguishing was lowest when ChatGPT was instructed to write a paper as a student. These results strongly suggest the necessity for clear guidelines, plagiarism detection tools, and educational initiatives to promote ethical use of AI technology. © 2024, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - Recent years have seen the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered generative chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Microsoft's Copilot. These tools have simultaneously positively surprised and taken aback people worldwide, raising the question of whether they can or should be used in education, as well as how to properly guide students and teachers on using them safely and ethically. To this end, this work provides (i) a brief overview of the current applications of AI in Higher Education (HE), (ii) a discussion of the ethical and societal concerns associated with the usage of AI models, (iii) the initial steps of the implementation of a chatbot used at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) able to perform audits for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and (iv) an investigation of the need and opportunities of AI in chemical engineering education. The latter is achieved through quantitative and qualitative analyses of the responses given by both Master's students and academia/industry practitioners on the introduction and use of AI in education. This paves the way for discussing current perceptions, expectations and concerns of AI models, as well as their limitations and the opportunities they could provide. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In recent months, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had, and will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Journal of Academic Librarianship
AB  - This article addresses three key questions related to the ethical facets of algorithmic literacy. First, it synthesizes existing literature to identify six core ethical components, including bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, accuracy, and non-maleficence. Second, a crosswalk maps the intersections of these principles across the Association of College and Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and Joint Statement on Principles for Responsible Algorithmic Systems. This analysis reveals significant overlap on issues like unfairness and transparency, helping prioritize topics for instruction. Finally, case studies showcase pedagogical strategies for teaching ethical considerations, informed by the crosswalk. Workshops for diverse undergraduates and computer science students employed reallife instances of algorithmic bias to prompt reflection on unintended harm, contestability, and responsible development. Pre-post surveys indicated expanded critical perspectives after the interventions. By systematically examining shared values and testing instructional approaches, this study provides practical tools to shape ethical thinking on algorithms. It also demonstrates promising practices for responsibly advancing algorithmic literacy across disciplines. Ultimately, fostering interdisciplinary awareness and multipronged educational initiatives can empower students to question algorithmic authority and biases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ethical concerns for using artificial intelligence chatbots in research and publication: Evidences from Saudi Arabia
AU  - Sobaih, A.E.E.
T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational generative chatbots have drawn the attention of academics and have been increasingly used in the scientific research process since the inauguration of ChatGPT in November 2022. Despite growing research on AI chatbots’ usage in research and publication, limited studies have deeply addressed the ethical concerns that arise from their usage. This research explores the perceptions of academics and their leaders regarding the use of AI chatbots in research and publication. It addresses the ethical dilemma and ethical approaches considered by academics and their leaders for shaping their decisions for the use or non-use of chatbots in scientific research. For these purposes, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 academics/researchers and 11 leaders of scientific research in public universities in Saudi Arabia. The results of the thematic analysis confirmed that AI chatbots are extensively used in scientific research, albeit many researchers present their publications as their own work with no acknowledgement of the support from chatbots. The results showed ten interrelated ethical concerns, which would impact the growth of pseudoscience in developing countries if these concerns were not overcome. Hence, strategies for mitigating these ethical concerns are suggested. The research showed that academics often use chatbots based on a “utilitarian” approach, whereas most leaders consider the “virtue” or the “common good” approach for their concerns about chatbot adoption in scientific research. This research calls for policy and interventions from policymakers and other stakeholders about the responsible and ethical use of chatbots in research and publication. © 2024. Abu Elnasr E. Sobaih.

AB  - The increasing dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing tools among advanced learners has sparked concerns about academic dishonesty, prompting stakeholders to develop ways to maintain academic integrity. The study explored the role of academic librarians in maintaining academic integrity with the prevalence of AI writing tools among students. The study was conducted through qualitative methods with a phenomenological design. A semi-structured interview was used to collect data from twelve academic librarians in six universities in Ghana. The data was analysed thematically with word clouds. The findings of the study revealed that the roles of academic librarians are more tailored towards maintaining research integrity, an aspect of academic integrity. Also, the study observed that academic librarians play relevant roles in empowering students on the ethical use of information in the current dispensation of AI application tools in learning. Based on the study's findings, it is recommended a skill upgrade of library staff in evolving AI technology in response to issues of academic misconduct among students. Furthermore, the study suggests that academic institutions should revise academic integrity policies to address the increasing use of AI writing tools among students. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The high performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) in examination contexts has triggered an intense debate about their applications, effects and risks. What legal aspects need to be considered when using LLM in teaching and assessment? What possibilities do language models offer? Statutes and laws are used to assess the use of LLM: – University statutes, state higher education laws, licensing regulations for doctors – Copyright Act (UrhG) – General Data Protection Regulation (DGPR) – AI Regulation (EU AI Act) LLM and AI offer opportunities but require clear university frameworks. These should define legitimate uses and areas where use is prohibited. Cheating and plagiarism violate good scientific practice and copyright laws. Cheating is difficult to detect. Plagiarism by AI is possible. Users of the products are responsible. LLM are effective tools for generating exam questions. Nevertheless, careful review is necessary as even apparently high-quality products may contain errors. However, the risk of copyright infringement with AI-generated exam questions is low, as copyright law allows up to 15% of protected works to be used for teaching and exams. The grading of exam content is subject to higher education laws and regulations and the GDPR. Exclusively computer-based assessment without human review is not permitted. For high-risk applications in education, the EU's AI Regulation will apply in the future. When dealing with LLM in assessments, evaluation criteria for existing assessments can be adapted, as can assessment programmes, e.g. to reduce the motivation to cheat. LLM can also become the subject of the examination themselves. Teachers should undergo further training in AI and consider LLM as an addition. © 2024 März et al.

TI  - Assessing law students in a GenAI world to create knowledgeable future lawyers
AU  - Head, A.

T2  - International Journal of the Legal Profession
AB  - Assessing law students has always been a challenging task, but the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, compounds the problems already caused by increased student numbers, contract cheating and budget cuts in universities. As GenAI rapidly develops, legal educators must find ways to accommodate, and even incorporate, GenAI into their curricula and assessments so that law graduates can understand its capabilities and limitations within legal practice. Simultaneously, many jurisdictions, including Australia, have legislative obligations to deliver law graduates who satisfy legal knowledge-based “eligibility” requirements for admission into practice. This article introduces a knowledge framework for managing GenAI in legal education consisting of three pillars: Substantive Legal Knowledge, GenAI Ethics Knowledge, and GenAI System Knowledge. The authors argue this framework can assist legal educators in designing optimal assessments in an AI-disrupted world. The article employs the knowledge framework to examine the experiences and views of Australian law students’ engagement with GenAI outputs in completing a compulsory legal ethics assessment in 2023. This empirical case study demonstrates that effective assessment design incorporating GenAI can enhance law student and graduate outcomes despite the ongoing challenges for legal educators and the profession associated with GenAI. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study sought to understand the perceptions of academics and teaching and learning (T&L) specialists on the use of AI tools and large language models on assessment development, whether the private HE institution (PHEI) needs to change how it assesses students, and the types of assessments to be created. This topic is extremely relevant, as many higher education institutions (HEIs) are entering unchartered territory, and there is scant credible evidence on the prior-implementation reporting and evaluation of AI integration into assessment practices. Forty academics and T&L specialists at a PHEI in South Africa shared their perceptions. The study revealed two key themes: (a) AI use and (b) reconceptualizing assessments and T&L structures, indicating the need for HEIs to understand the synergies between AI and assessment practices. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This mixed-methods study aims to examine factors influencing academicians’ intentions to continue using AI-based chatbots by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and social network characteristics. Background AI-powered chatbots are gaining popularity across industries, including academia. However, empirical research on academicians’ adoption behavior is limited. This study proposes an integrated model incorporating TTF factors and social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness to understand academics’ continuance intentions. Methodology A qualitative study involving 31 interviews of academics from India examined attitudes and the potential role of social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness in adoption. Results showed positive sentiment towards chatbots and themes on how peer groups accelerate diffusion. In the second phase, a survey of 448 faculty members from prominent Indian universities was conducted to test the proposed research model. Contribution The study proposes and validates an integrated model of TTF and social network factors that influence academics’ continued usage intentions toward AI chatbots. It highlights the nuanced role of peer networks in shaping adoption. Findings Task and technology characteristics positively affected academics’ intentions to continue AI chatbot usage. Among network factors, density showed the strongest effect on TTF and perceived usefulness, while homophily and connectedness had partial effects. The study provides insights into designing appropriate AI tools for the academic context. Recommendations AI chatbot designers should focus on aligning features to academics’ task for Practitioners needs and preferences. Compatibility with academic work culture is critical. Given peer network influences, training and demonstrations to user groups can enhance adoption. Platforms should have capabilities for collaborative use. Targeted messaging customized to disciplines can resonate better with academic subgroups. Multidisciplinary influencers should be engaged. Concerns like plagiarism risks, privacy, and job impacts should be transparently addressed. Recommendations More studies are needed across academic subfields to understand nuanced for Researchers requirements and barriers. Further studies are recommended to investigate differences across disciplines and demographics, relative effects of specific network factors like size, proximity, and frequency of interaction, the role of academic leadership and institutional policies in enabling chatbot adoption, and how AI training biases impact usefulness perceptions and ethical issues. Impact on Society Increased productivity in academia through the appropriate and ethical use of AI can enhance quality, access, and equity in education. AI can assist in mundane tasks, freeing academics’ time for higher-order objectives like critical thinking development. Responsible AI design and policies considering socio-cultural aspects will benefit sustainable growth. With careful implementation, it can make positive impacts on student engagement, learning support, and research efficiency. Future Research Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impacts of AI chatbot usage in academia. Track usage behaviors over time as familiarity develops. Investigate differences across academic disciplines and roles. Requirements may vary for humanities versus STEM faculty or undergraduate versus graduate students. Assess user trust in AI and how it evolves with repeated usage, and examine trust-building strategies. Develop frameworks to assess pedagogical effectiveness and ethical risks of conversational agents in academic contexts.

TI  - Academic integrity surrounding the use of generative AI in higher education: Lenses from ICT college students
AU  - Plecerda, L.P.
T2  - Environment and Social Psychology
AB  - The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) in education marks a transformative shift in teaching, learning, and assessment practices. GenAI technologies have evolved from being simple conversational agents to highly advanced systems capable of generating human-like text, solving complex problems, assisting in creative writing, tutoring, and even providing personalized feedback to students. This paper explored the use of GenAI in education with emphasis on its implications towards academic integrity. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) college students (n=30) were purposively sampled to be interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions about the use of GenAI in their program. Thematic analysis was carried out to identify emerging themes and assess the implications of GenAI use in education, particularly ICT learning processes. Students believed that GenAI offers significant benefits, such as personalized learning, assistance in creative writing, tutoring, coding, and grading, which enhance students’ learning experiences by providing instant feedback and helping them understand difficult concepts. Concerns about over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty have emerged, as some students use AI tools to bypass intellectual effort, raising questions about the authenticity of their work. ICT students expressed concerns about GenAI fostering cheating and undermining academic independence. Despite these issues, students remain optimistic about GenAI’s role in education, advocating for clear guidelines on its appropriate use to balance its benefits with the need for academic integrity. The integration of GenAI in educational settings necessitates careful management to ensure that it supports, rather than diminishes, the learning process. © 2024 by author(s).

TI  - ‘Words are Flowing Out Like Endless Rain Into a Paper Cup’: ChatGPT & Law School Assessments
AU  - Hargreaves, S.
T2  - Legal Education Review
AB  - ChatGPT is a sophisticated large-language model able to answer high-level questions in a way that is does not trigger conventional plagiarism detectors. Concerns have been raised that and similar forms of ‘generative AI’ pose a significant threat to academic integrity in higher education. To evaluate this risk in the context of legal education specifically, this project had ChatGPT (using the GPT3.5 model available in January 2023) generate answers to twenty-four different exams from an English-language law school based in a common law jurisdiction. It found that the system performed best on exams that were essay-based and asked students to discuss international legal instruments or general legal principles not necessarily specific to any jurisdiction. It performed worst on exams that featured problem-style or “issue spotting” questions asking students to apply an invented factual scenario to local legislation or jurisprudence. While the project suggests that for the most part conventional law school assessments are for the time being relatively immune from the threat generative AI brings, the project provides only a baseline snapshot of how large-language models tackle assessment in higher education. As both the technology improves and students learn how to harness it, increasingly fewer forms of assessment will be beyond its reach. However, rather than attempt to block students from using AI as part of learning and assessment, this paper instead proposes three ways students may be taught to use it in appropriate and ethical ways. While it is clear that generative AI will change how universities teach and assess (across disciplines), a solution of prevention or denial is no solution at all. © 2023, Australasian Law Academics Association.

T2  - Brazilian Journal of Occupational Therapy
AB  - Public access to artificial intelligence, and specifically to ChatGPT, is presenting challenges in the professional training of occupational therapists. In this context, this essay aims to describe the impact of artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on ChatGPT, on the training of occupational therapists and proposes strategies to integrate these technologies into higher education from an integrative, ethical perspective, in line with the values and principles of academic integrity. While this tool can be used to provide theoretical knowledge and enhance content learning, it also poses a risk for dishonest behaviors in the academic realm. Therefore, it is essential that educators understand its use and promote experiential methodologies that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and reflection. The challenge lies in the implementation of policies and strategies that promote the development of professional skills and the ethical and effective use of these technologies in training future occupational therapists, such as declaring its use in written works, modeling by teachers, and integration into training methodologies. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

AB  - In August 2020, students took to the streets of London in a mass protest over their A-level results (that determine entry to university), chanting 'F∗ck the algorithm.' Their A-level grades had been determined by an algorithm that depended on past school performance, a system of teacher ratings, and for smaller student groups, the use of Centre Assessed Grades. Commendably Ofqual (the U.K. Government Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) were transparent in their use of the algorithm so that affected stakeholders were informed of the algorithm's existence and the key details of how it was developed. The design of the data set produced an algorithm with biased outputs, which hardcoded preexisting educational, policy, and societal biases. Due to the large numbers of students, the single 'results day' output and the wider interests of schools, teachers, parents, and universities, the unfairness of the outcome was magnified. Add to this that the students were, by definition, academically proficient individuals, many of whom derived from privileged and supportive backgrounds, which meant that they had the awareness and capacity to challenge. Hence, the impact of this biased algorithm was not received silently and so it was hard to deny, deflect, and dismiss. However, this is not always the case, and many systems are deployed with similar biases and harmful outcomes but the impact is dissipated over time and individuals, and therefore not so immediately obvious and easy to challenge. This is particularly the case when the people impacted do not have the advantages that enabled the A-level students to challenge. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AU  - Henry, J.V.

T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - Critics of artificial intelligence have suggested that the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency (FATE) have been used for ‘ethics washing’, in order to appease industrial interests. In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) first made its entry into higher education in the form of paraphrasing tools. These tools were used to take passages that were copied from sources, and through various methods, disguised the original text to avoid academic integrity violations. At first, these tools were not very good and produced nearly incomprehensible output. However, through the use of generative artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the current engines supporting these tools have become better and more efficient at producing quality output. Recently, the artificial intelligence research company, OpenAI, developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence engine to drive a conversational chat frontend application called ChatGPT. Backed by an expansive knowledge base that could rival any university library in volume, this AI-driven conversational application can produce well-written, seemingly academic, responses to questions.

University teachers (n = 24) from four different departments in humanities and social sciences participated in Turing Test-inspired experiments, where they blindly assessed student and ChatGPT-written responses to home examination questions. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews in focus groups with the same teachers examining their reflections about the quality of the texts they assessed. Regarding chatbot-generated texts, we found a passing rate range across the cohort (37.5-85.7%) and a chatbot-written suspicion range (14-23%). Regarding the student-written texts, we identified patterns of down

We present the emergent framework, Students' Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students' use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students' use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.

AB  - This paper shares the reflections of a small group of graduate students and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the challenges and affordances of using large language model (LLM) tools to assist with academic writing in an English Medium Education (EME) context. The influence of interpretive grounded theory afforded the authors the opportunity to engage with emerging data from a focus group interview. Ethical issues including academic integrity and maturity formed a major theme of this study, as well as the future-thinking affordances of LLMs in facilitating and democratizing academic writing for all, including those in EME programs. Considering that LLMs are here to stay and will be used by students and faculty alike, the authors consider that the nature of assessment is likely to change and indeed will require higher education institutions to consider the types of assessments in place, with a view to potentially modifying them in light of these technological advance

AB  - Artificial intelligence-based tools are rapidly revolutionizing the field of higher education, yet to be explored in terms of their impact on existing higher education institutions' (HEIs) practices adopted for continuous learning improvement, given the sparsity of the literature and empirical experiments in undergraduate degree programs. After the entry of ChatGPT–a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses a deep learning model to generate human-like text response based on provided input–it has become crucial for HEIs to be exposed to the implications of AI-based tools on students' learning outcomes, commonly measured using an assessment-based approach to improve program quality, teaching effectiveness, and other learning support. An empirical study has been conducted to test the ChatGPT capability of solving a variety of assignments (from different level courses of undergraduate degree programs) to compare its performance with the highest scored student(s).

AB  - With artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively applied in education, human-centered AI (HCAI) has become an active field. There although has been increasing concern about how to systematically enhance the AI applications effect, AI risk governance in HCAI education has not been discussed yet. This study adopted literature meta-analysis, along with the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods in order to establish the risk framework and calculate the index weight of HCAI education. The results confirm that the risk framework includes eight indicators, which respectively are misunderstanding of the HCAI concept (MC), misuse of AI resources (MR), mismatching of AI pedagogy (MP), privacy security risk (PSR), transparency risk (TR), accountability risk (AR), bias risk (BR), and perceived risk (PR). Meanwhile, the eight indicators are divided into four categories such as HCAI concept, application process, ethical security, and man-machine interaction. Moreover, the trend of ris

TI  - The Use of Al in Education: Practicalities and Ethical Considerations
AU  - Reiss, Michael J.
T2  - London Review of Education
AB  - There is a wide diversity of views on the potential for artificial intelligence (AI), ranging from overenthusiastic pronouncements about how it is imminently going to transform our lives to alarmist predictions about how it is going to cause everything from mass unemployment to the destruction of life as we know it. In this article, I look at the practicalities of AI in education and at the attendant ethical issues it raises. My key conclusion is that AI in the near- to medium-term future has the potential to enrich student learning and complement the work of (human) teachers without dispensing with them. In addition, AI should increasingly enable such traditional divides as 'school versus home' to be straddled with regard to learning. AI offers the hope of increasing personalization in education, but it is accompanied by risks of learning becoming less social. There is much that we can learn from previous introductions of new technologies in school to help maximize the likelihood tha

AB  - This article was motivated by the need to academically frame and share the response of the North-West University (NWU) to the perceived increase of academic dishonesty during COVID-19. Within the ambit of the online (hybrid) teaching and learning approach that became dominant during the COVID-19 pandemic, the NWU established a Community of Practice for Academic Integrity (CoPAI) to enhance Academic Integrity (AI) in a holistic manner. By critically discussing the NWU's response through their CoPAI, the lessons learned, and strategies developed in the process, the NWU can hopefully assist other Higher Education institutes to progressively enhance AI in the future. This is important, because many contextual shifts in teaching and learning approaches, pedagogy, assessment, and the application of technology, that were enforced in an online mode of delivery during the pandemic, will prevail in future. In writing this article, we focused on contextualising the NWU CoPAI within current liter

AB  - Artificial intelligence has evolved since its inception in the 1950s, resulting in the creation of large language models that are trained on extensive data sets to understand and generate content, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. Modern technology that is easy to access and free to use, like ChatGPT, is changing the educational landscape as it is an example of a large language model – an artificial intelligence network – that can process and generate text that reads as though it were written by a person. Using a survey and semi-structured interviews, this exploratory mixed-method study examined social work educators' experiences of addressing students' use of ChatGPT and found that although they are uncomfortable with addressing ChatGPT use with their students, they believe it is necessary to communicate its ethical use to them. Results also suggested that while using ChatGPT as a learning tool is valid, it can be overused. ChatGPT use gives students a fals

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT has left people feeling ambivalent and disagreement among scholars, academicians, educators and the community at large prevails. While the artificial intelligence could potentially revolutionize how research is conducted and how research papers are written, a number of ethical concerns arise. In particular, the world of academia has reservations pertaining to whether this language model will actually do more good than harm, especially as far as academic writing is concerned. This paper argues that the cutting-edge technology is here to stay and the question is not whether to accept it, but rather, how to best utilize it judiciously, cautiously and responsibly to improve research performance by strictly adhering to academic integrity and transparency. Potential benefits and drawbacks of ChatGPT will be critically examined in light of current literature and, when relevant, potential solutions to the drawbacks will also

Considerations of potential harm and ethical implications have not kept pace, raising concerns about ethical and privacy issues (Holstein &amp; Doroudi, 2019; Prinsloo &amp; Slade, 2018). This empirical study contributes to a growing critical conversation on fairness, equity, and responsibility of LA lending mentor voices in the context of an online mentorship program through which undergraduate students mentored secondary school students. Specifically, this study responds to a phenomenon shared by four mentors who recounted hiding from mentees that they had seen their LA data. Interviews reveal the convergent and divergent ideas of mentors regarding LA in terms of: (1) affordances and constraints; (2) scope and boundaries; (3) ethical tensions and dilemmas; (4) paradoxical demands; and (5) what constitutes fairness, e

The study was conducted over 3 years at a large Australian university, and findings demonstrate that familiarity with the system over time improved student attitudes towards remote invigilation. Positive experiences were found to be related to ease of use and convenience for test sitting. The majority of students reported that it was important for the institution to have approaches such as remote invigilation to discourage cheating and they believed that the system was useful in this regard. Perceived technical problems were found to invoke feelings of anxiety with being remotely invigilated, and students suggested that greater clarity on expectations of appropriate behaviour, privacy and data security would help alleviate discomfort and improve the system.
