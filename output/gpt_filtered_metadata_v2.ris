T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
AB  - Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into education, specifically through generative chatbots, can transform teaching and learning for education professionals in both administrative and pedagogical ways. However, the ethical implications of using generative chatbots in education must be carefully considered. Ethical concerns about advanced chatbots have yet to be explored in the education sector. This short article introduces the ethical concerns associated with introducing platforms such as ChatGPT in education. The article outlines how handling sensitive student data by chatbots presents significant privacy challenges, thus requiring adherence to data protection regulations, which may not always be possible. It highlights the risk of algorithmic bias in chatbots, which could perpetuate societal biases, which can be problematic. The article also examines the balance between fostering student autonomy in learning and the potential impact on academic self-efficacy, noting the risk of over-reliance on AI for educational purposes. Plagiarism continues to emerge as a critical ethical concern, with AI-generated content threatening academic integrity. The article advocates for comprehensive measures to address these ethical issues, including clear policies, advanced plagiarism detection techniques, and innovative assessment methods. By addressing these ethical challenges, the article argues that educators, AI developers, policymakers, and students can fully harness the potential of chatbots in education, creating a more inclusive, empowering, and ethically sound educational future.

T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study explores the role of perceived utility, social influence, and ethical concerns in the adoption of AI-based data analysis tools among academic researchers in China, focusing on differences between public and private universities. The research aims to identify key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of AI technology in academic settings. A quantitative approach was employed, using a multi-group structural equation model (SEM) analysis to assess data collected from 750 academic researchers across various disciplines (N-pvt = 402; N-pub = 348). The findings reveal that both perceived utility and social influence significantly influence the adoption of AI tools. Higher perceived utility and stronger social influence lead to greater adoption. However, ethical concerns were found to moderate these relationships, particularly in public universities, where researchers with high ethical concerns perceived greater risks, thereby reducing their likelihood of adoption. In contrast, private university researchers showed a higher tolerance for perceived risks when utility and social influence were evident. The study's implications suggest that to promote AI adoption, institutions must address ethical concerns and perceived risks, particularly in public universities, by enhancing transparency, providing ethical guidelines, and offering comprehensive training. These efforts can lead to more effective integration of AI technologies, ultimately enhancing research productivity and innovation across diverse academic environments.

AB  - This paper provides a thorough examination of the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT and other AI language models, in the realm of education. Drawing insights from existing literature and a novel study on educator perspectives, the paper delves into the potential advantages, ethical dilemmas, and factors shaping educators' attitudes towards AI integration in education. AI language models have the potential to revolutionize educational content creation, personalize learning experiences, and streamline assessment and feedback processes. These capabilities hold the potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes while catering to the diverse needs of students. However, ethical concerns loom large in the adoption of AI in education. Bias in generated content is a chief concern, as it can perpetuate societal biases and lead to unfair treatment or the dissemination of inaccurate information. The solution lies in rigorous data curation to ensure equitable educational experiences for all students. Moreover, the potential for generating inappropriate or misleading content poses a significant ethical challenge, impacting students' well-being, civic understanding, and social interactions. Safeguards must be implemented to detect and rectify biased or inappropriate content, fostering inclusive and unbiased learning environments. Transparency emerges as a crucial ethical consideration. The opacity of AI models like ChatGPT makes it difficult to comprehend their decision-making processes. Enhancing model interpretability and explainability is vital for accountability and addressing embedded ethical issues. Privacy concerns related to data collection and usage are emphasized in the literature. Clear policies and guidelines must govern data collection, use, and protection, ensuring data is solely employed for educational purposes and maintaining robust data security measures. Our study expands upon these insights by exploring socio-demographic factors, motivations, and social influences affecting educators' AI adoption in higher education. These findings inform institutions on tailoring AI integration strategies, emphasizing responsible usage through training, and assessing the impact on learning outcomes. As educational institutions increasingly embrace AI, including advanced models like GPT-4, a cautious and thoughtful approach is vital. Balancing potential benefits with ethical challenges ensures that AI enhances teaching and learning while upholding fairness, equity, and accountability. In summary, this paper illuminates the potential of AI in education, accentuates ethical concerns, and highlights the significance of understanding educators' perspectives. Collaboration between educators and policymakers is essential to navigate the complexities of AI integration, ensuring that education remains a realm of equitable, efficient, and accountable learning experiences.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools hold significant promises for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. However, continues usage behavior and satisfaction of educators with GenAI systems are still less explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors influencing academic staff satisfaction and continuous GenAI usage in higher education, employing a survey method and analyzing data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This research utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) as its theoretical foundations, while also integrating ethical concerns as a significant factor. Data was collected from a sample of 127 university academic staff through an online survey questionnaire. The study found a positive correlation between effort expectancy, ethical consideration, expectation confirmation, and academic staff satisfaction. However, performance expectancy did not show a positive correlation with satisfaction. Performance expectancy was positively related to the intention to use GenAI tools, while academic staff satisfaction positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The social influence did not correlate positively with the use of GenAI. Security and privacy were positively associated with staff satisfaction. Facilitation conditions also positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for academia and policymakers, guiding the responsible integration of GenAI tools in education while emphasizing factors for policy considerations and developers of GenAI tools.

AB  - This study examines the potentials and challenges of integrating conversational AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools in higher education. Specifically, the study delves into how ChatGPT is reshaping teaching, learning, research, and student evaluation while addressing ethical concerns such as academic integrity. We employ a qualitative research design based on semi-structured interviews with 12 highly accomplished academicians from North America, Asia, and Europe's higher education institutions. Our analysis reveals ChatGPT's potential to uplift educational productivity, learning outcomes, creativity, and idea generation but raises apprehensions about academic honesty, authenticity, and over-reliance. While ChatGPT can enhance educational practices such as brainstorming, analysis, and skills acquisition, its unchecked use may impede learning, critical thinking, and research quality. The study advocates for the responsible AI use in academia, underscoring educators and policymakers to establish policies guiding conversational AI ethical applications. Thus, training faculty and executing institutional policies are essential for effective and ethical integration of ChatGPT and other AI tools in higher education. Finally, this research contributes to ongoing research on AI in education by providing valuable insights that can harness potential of these transformative tools while upholding academic integrity and standards.

T2  - RELIEVE-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y EVALUACION EDUCATIVA
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized the field of higher education, and sparked debates on the potential of tools such as ChatGPT, Humata.ai or Sudowrite in teaching, learning and assessment processes. While their integration in this context offers numerous opportunities ( e.g., instant feedback, generation of resources and teaching materials, adaptive learning, interactivity, etc.), it also poses significant challenges that raise ethical and academic integrity concerns, such as the reliability of information, transparency regarding the sources used, or data privacy and security. The aim of this article is to examine the ethical implications of GAI in higher education from a three-fold perspective (students, faculty, and institutions). Additionally, it aims to analyze its impact on aspects related to security, accessibility, sustainability and even new forms of plagiarism and academic fraud that involve impersonation of authorship. Based on the literature review conducted, and in accordance with the ideas proposed by some authors, possibilities for integrating GAI into university classrooms will be explored. This will be achieved through pedagogical practices that guide students in the proper use of GAI and enable faculty to seek new educational approaches. This transformation process will require the establishment of clear guidelines that align with ethical codes and integrity policies of higher education institutions. Ultimately, the reflection on how to combine education, innovation, and academic integrity will provide these three groups with a new opportunity to drive improvements in university education.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with its ability to create original content and simulate human interactions, is rapidly transforming various sectors, including higher education. This article introduces the main uses and challenges and reveals the most relevant perceptions, challenges and opportunities surrounding the implementation of AI in higher education. Based on a survey of university professors from the Red Estatal de Docencia Universitaria (REDU), a variety of perceptions are revealed, from enthusiasm for GenAI's potential to personalize learning and automate tasks to concerns about its ethical and pedagogical implications, such as plagiarism and dependence on the technology. Identified uses of AI include educational content generation, automated feedback, and the creation of immersive learning environments. Notable challenges included institutional barriers, lack of access to up-to-date resources, and difficulties integrating GenAI into teaching practice effectively and ethically. Teachers expressed a clear interest in receiving specific training on AI, both in technical and pedagogical aspects, to take full advantage of its potential and mitigate its risks. These findings point to the need to address the identified challenges and promote ongoing faculty training to boost the potential of GenAI in higher education. Future research should deepen the understanding of faculty perceptions and needs, as well as the development of effective strategies for the implementation of GenAI in the university context, taking into account both its benefits and challenges.

T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The rapid integration of artificial intelligence in academic environments has created unprecedented challenges for maintaining academic integrity, particularly concerning AI-facilitated plagiarism (AIgiarism). Using stratified random sampling, we surveyed 373 undergraduate students across government universities in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate the complex interplay between institutional support mechanisms, moral-psychological processes, and students' engagement with AI tools in academic work. Through validated instruments, our research reveals a moderated mediation model where attitudes towards AI technology significantly mediate the relationship between academic support and AIgiarism (beta = -0.384, p < .001), with moral disengagement moderating both paths (beta = 0.152, p < .002; beta = 0.178, p < .001). These findings challenge traditional deterrence-based approaches to academic integrity and introduce the 'Mediated Digital Integrity Model,' emphasizing the dynamic interplay between institutional, attitudinal, and moral factors. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on digital academic integrity and provides crucial insights for developing integrated AI ethics programs in higher education.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB  - An open access article under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more widely used in higher education, we must pay attention to the risks that can emerge. AI projects, whether applied in classroom learning or used for decision-making regarding admissions, financial aid allocation, or hiring, must include attention to governance and compliance issues, regardless of the project's scope and scale. Concerns highlighted in this work include transparency, user privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability, however, we note that this is a non-exhaustive list of risks. In this paper, risk assessment is defined, and two examples of risk management frameworks, namely the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework and the non-profit humanitarian effort ForHumanity's Independent Audit of AI, Algorithmic, and Autonomous Systems are briefly described. We identify characteristics of AI applications that need to be assessed for vulnerabilities they may present, such as bias and discrimination. This paper aims to facilitate discussion among stakeholders about the risks that may be encountered from using AI in higher education, as well as to suggest ways developers, decision-makers, and users can mitigate these risks. Much discussion and published literature has focused on risk management frameworks designed for large organizations or enterprises or frameworks that do not consider risks specific to AI. We hope that decision-makers carefully consider the risks, perform due diligence when implementing AI applications, and create a plan for mitigating the risks. This research supports e-learning practice because students and faculty are embracing AI applications. Leaders and decision-makers in higher education need to be proactive in protecting their varied stakeholders. The paper asks what risks may be encountered by institutions of higher education when using AI tools and products in the classroom and for various aspects of decision-making and if published frameworks can mitigate these risks.

TI  - AI, Biometric Analysis, and Emerging Cheating Detection Systems: The Engineering of Academic Integrity?
AU  - Oravec, JA
T2  - EDUCATION POLICY ANALYSIS ARCHIVES
AB  - Cheating behaviors have been construed as a continuing and somewhat vexing issue for academic institutions as they increasingly conduct educational processes online and impose metrics on instructional evaluation. Research, development, and implementation initiatives on cheating detection have gained new dimensions in the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) applications; they have also engendered special challenges in terms of their social, ethical, and cultural implications. An assortment of commercial cheating-detection systems have been injected into educational contexts with little input on the part of relevant stakeholders. This paper expands several specific cases of how systems for the detection of cheating have recently been implemented in higher education institutions in the US and UK. It investigates how such vehicles as wearable technologies, eye scanning, and keystroke capturing are being used to collect the data used for anti-cheating initiatives, often involving systems that have not gone through rigorous testing and evaluation for their validity and potential educational impacts. The paper discusses accountability- and policy-related issues concerning the outsourcing of cheating detection in institutional settings in the light of these emerging technological practices as well as student resistance against the systems involved. The cheating-detection practices can place students in a disempowered, asymmetrical position that is often at substantial variance with their cultural backgrounds.

T2  - INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The use of generative AI is controversial in education largely because of its potential impact on academic integrity. Yet some scholars have suggested it could be particularly beneficial for students with disabilities. To date there has been no empirical research to discover how these students use generative AI in academic writing. Informed by a prior interview study and AI-literacy model, we surveyed students regarding their use of generative AI, and gained 124 valid responses from students with disabilities. We identified primary conditions affecting writing such as ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autism. The main generative AI used were chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, and rewriting applications. They were used in a wide range of academic writing tasks. Key concerns students with disabilities had included the inaccuracy of AI answers, risks to academic integrity, and subscription cost barriers. Students expressed a strong desire to participate in AI policymaking and for universities to provide generative AI training. The paper concludes with recommendations to address educational disparities and foster inclusivity.

AB  - Generative AI has prompted educators to reevaluate traditional teaching and assessment methods. This study examines AI's ability to write essays analysing Old English poetry; human markers assessed and attempted to distinguish them from authentic analyses of poetry by first-year undergraduate students in English at the University of Oxford. Using the standard UK University grading system, AI-written essays averaged a score of 60.46, whilst human essays achieved 63.57, a margin of difference not statistically significant (p = 0.10). Notably, student submissions applied a nuanced understanding of cultural context and secondary criticism to their close reading, while AI essays often described rather than analysed, lacking depth in the evaluation of poetic features, and sometimes failing to properly recognise key aspects of passages. Distinguishing features of human essays included detailed and sustained analysis of poetic style, as well as spelling errors and lack of structural cohesion. AI essays, on the other hand, exhibited a more formal structure and tone but sometimes fell short in incisive critique of poetic form and effect. Human markers correctly identified the origin of essays 79.41% of the time. Additionally, we compare three purported AI detectors, finding that the best, 'Quillbot', correctly identified the origin of essays 95.59% of the time. However, given the high threshold for academic misconduct, conclusively determining origin remains challenging. The research also highlights the potential benefits of generative AI's ability to advise on structuring essays and suggesting avenues for research. We advocate for transparency regarding AI's capabilities and limitations, and this study underscores the importance of human critical engagement in teaching and learning in Higher Education. As AI's proficiency grows, educators must reevaluate what authentic assessment is, and consider implementing dynamic, holistic methods to ensure academic integrity.

AB  - This study examines the determinants of the sustainable use of artificial intelligence (AI) among university professors in Peru. This research adopted a quantitative approach through a cross-sectional empirical–explanatory study, employing a structural equation model. Data were collected from 368 professors from eight Peruvian universities using a structured questionnaire that assessed six main constructs: attitude toward AI, prejudice against AI, facilitating conditions, use of AI, teaching concerns, and ethical perception. While the results reveal significant correlational relationships—with attitude toward AI, facilitating conditions, and prejudice against AI showing a significant association with its sustainable use, and the use of AI showing a significant relationship with professors’ ethical perceptions—the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes causal inferences. No significant relationship was found between the use of AI and teaching concerns. Additionally, demographic variables such as gender and age did not exhibit significant moderating effects. These findings contribute to understanding the factors related to the sustainable adoption of AI in higher education and provide valuable insights for the development of effective institutional strategies in the Latin American context. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Integrating generative AI (GAI) into higher education is crucial for preparing a future generation of GAI-literate students. However, a comprehensive understanding of global institutional adoption policies remains absent, with most prior studies focusing on the Global North and lacking a theoretical lens. This study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to examine GAI adoption strategies in higher education across 40 universities from six global regions. It explores the characteristics of GAI innovation, including compatibility, trialability, and observability, and analyses the communication channels and roles and responsibilities outlined in university policies and guidelines. The findings reveal that universities are proactively addressing GAI integration by emphasising academic integrity, enhancing teaching and learning practices, and promoting equity. Key policy measures include the development of guidelines for ethical GAI use, the design of authentic assessments to mitigate misuse, and the provision of training programs for faculty and students to foster GAI literacy. Despite these efforts, gaps remain in comprehensive policy frameworks, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns and ensuring equitable access to GAI tools. The study underscores the importance of clear communication channels, stakeholder collaboration, and ongoing evaluation to support effective GAI adoption. These insights provide actionable insights for policymakers to craft inclusive, transparent, and adaptive strategies for integrating GAI into higher education. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Discover Education
AB  - Written assignments for large classes pose a far more significant challenge in the age of the GenAI revolution. Suggestions such as oral exams and formative assessments are not always feasible with many students in a class. Therefore, we conducted a study in South Africa and involved 280 Honors students to explore the usefulness of Turnitin's AI detector in conjunction with student self-reflection. Using a Mixed Methods Research (MMR) approach, we analysed data generated from the Turnitin AI reports, our grading rubrics, and qualitative student self-reflection. The findings show that incorporating self-reflection into assessments supports ethical GenAI use and improves the transparency lecturers need for decision-making. A declaration form allowed the students to be upfront about using Generative Artificial Intelligence tools. We found that students who can reflect on their learning relied less on generated content. However, students with high AI detected scores (> 20%) did not adequately reflect on how the tools supported their learning and could not give credible explanations of use. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing students and academics with examples of responsibly handling AI-detected scores in large-class settings. We present a guided self-reflection and declaration with an AI detector to support students and help lecturers make decisions when grading. We also present a decision tree that lecturers and graders can use when evaluating AI use in assessments. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education, including how students approach examinations. This study addresses the growing reliance on AI in academic settings and its implications for learning and assessment integrity. The study aimed to analyze student reliance on AI in finding answers to midterm and final exams at the Ibnu Rusyd College of Tarbiyah (IRCT) Tanah Grogot, Indonesia. The research employed a mixed-methods approach through a survey of 98 Islamic Education Study Program students and interviews with 5 lecturers and 20 students. Data were analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis. The results show that 70% of the students utilized AI occasionally or frequently to complete exams, citing efficiency and ease of access. However, only 30% of the students felt that the use of AI supported an in-depth understanding of the material. Conversely, the lecturers highlighted that the overuse of AI risks reducing students' analytical skills. Quantitative analysis showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.45) between AI use and academic outcomes, while regression analysis revealed that other factors, such as lecturer guidance and learning motivation, were more significant in influencing academic success. This study recommends establishing clear institutional policies to regulate AI use, including a proctoring system in technology-based exams and the implementation of project-based learning to reduce student dependency on AI. Additionally, this study contributes novel insights into the ethical considerations of AI use in education and suggests that future research should explore the long-term behavioral impacts of AI reliance on student learning outcomes. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.

AB  - Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to enhance the educational experience, its use also presents challenges. This research examines the use and misuse of AI tools for university-related tasks. We surveyed 498 students from three faculties at a large European university to, first, identify factors driving their willingness to use AI tools for university-related tasks, and, second, estimate the prevalence of cheating behavior involving the unauthorized use of AI tools in examinations. Specifically, we tested and extended the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) by identifying trust and perceived opportunity costs as additional determinants of using AI tools for university-related tasks. To estimate the proportion of students cheating during examinations, we applied a randomized response technique. We discuss the results with respect to the effective and appropriate implementation of AI tools in higher education. Our findings can help educators and policymakers to promote responsible AI use while mitigating its misuse. © 2025 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Also, included in the study are; identification and exploration of limits, such as challenges faced by emerging technologies, meaning that students need to be cautious. Data breaches, biases in algorithms, scarce resources, and resistance to change will work as unique obstacles; hence, suggestions presented will be quite specific to each of these themes. Higher education will undergo transformative changes, traversing from inclusivity and innovation through the mechanisms of stronger governance, capacity building, and international cooperation; with AI, such pathways are possible. Such discoveries underscore the importance of developing interdisciplinary research capable of generating both transparent and effective frameworks. This would ensure that the longer-term impact of AI utilization is harmonized with educational and societal targets. © 2025, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students’ behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students’ BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER. These findings can help university students better accept and ethically use generative AI products. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence models into academic settings has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Given that researchers' interactions with and perceptions of these technologies can substantially influence academic procedures and outputs, identifying the key determinants of their incorporation into university environments is crucial. This investigation pursued two main objectives: first, to identify the variables that condition the implementation of AI models in research activities, and second, to analyze how perceived ethical considerations and academic integrity influence their adoption. The empirical study was conducted through a digital survey administered to 302 academic researchers from Peruvian public and private universities. The analytical methodology employed structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, grounded in an expanded version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model. The results demonstrated that six out of nine hypotheses were supported; social influence, educational self-efficacy, and academic integrity were identified as primary factors predicting researchers' use of AI models. Effort expectancy had a significant negative effect on AI model use. Furthermore, the use of AI models was found to significantly influence both teachers' concerns and perceived ethics among academics. Notably, performance expectancy, technological self-efficacy, and personal anxiety did not significantly affect AI model use. This study contributes to the understanding of AI adoption in academic research by highlighting the importance of social, educational, and ethical factors. These findings have implications for developing policies and training programs to promote responsible AI use in higher education and suggest a need to reevaluate traditional technology acceptance models in the context of AI in academia. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly embedded in daily life. In the field of education in particular, concerns have emerged about how these tools might positively or negatively impact student learning. In the current study, I conduct a randomized field experiment exploring how policies on genAI impact undergraduate students’ beliefs, behaviors, and grades. Students enrolled in two sections of the same upper-level undergraduate research methods course were randomly assigned to a section that either permitted or prohibited genAI tools. At the end of the semester, students enrolled in the section permitting genAI tools had a more positive view of genAI in higher education. However, students enrolled in the section prohibiting these tools had a higher final grade. These results highlight the need for evidence-based guidelines on how to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits of genAI in higher education. © 2025 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

T2  - British Journal of Educational Technology
AB  - Generative AI (hereinafter GenAI) technology, such as ChatGPT, is already influencing the higher education sector. In this work, we focused on the impact of GenAI on the academic integrity of assessments within higher education institutions, as GenAI can be used to circumvent assessment approaches within the sector, compromising their quality. The purpose of our research was threefold: first, to determine the extent to which the use of GenAI can be detected via the marking and moderation process; second, to understand whether the presence of GenAI affects the marking process; and finally, to establish whether authentic assessments can safeguard academic integrity. We used a series of experiments in the context of two UK-based universities to examine these issues. Our findings indicate that markers, in general, are not able to distinguish assessments that have had GenAI input from assessments that did not, even though the presence of GenAI affects the way markers approach the marking process. Our findings also suggest that the level of authenticity in an assessment has no impact on the ability to safeguard against or detect GenAI usage in assessment creation. In conclusion, we suggest that current approaches to assessments in higher education are susceptible to GenAI manipulation and that the higher education sector cannot rely on authentic assessments alone to control the impact of GenAI on academic integrity. Thus, we recommend giving more critical attention to assessment design and placing more emphasis on assessments that rely on social experiential learning and are performative rather than output-based and asynchronously written. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic GenAI has enabled students to complete higher education assessments quickly and with good quality, leading to challenges in academic integrity. GenAI has transformed the requirements and considerations in assessment design in higher education. Authentic assessments are seen as a prominent way to tackle the GenAI challenge. What this paper adds We provide quantitative and qualitative experimental evidence suggesting that GenAI can generate authentic assessments that pass the scrutiny of experienced academics. We demonstrate how the use of authentic assessments alone does not protect the academic integrity of students in higher education. Our qualitative analysis indicates that markers may generate false positive and false negative results if they suspect GenAI tampering in an assessment. Thus, students' learning is not assessed correctly. Implications for practice and/or policy When universities and national organisations design policies regarding GenAI, authentic assessments are not the panacea; the focus must remain on assessment design. Assessments of learning need to shift from assessing output to focusing on process and relevance to the workplace. That would mean a paradigmatic shift from written assessments to synchronous interpersonal assessments. The move away from written assessments has implications that are far reaching for the academy if written assessments cannot be trusted as a reliable indicator for and of learning. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the risks affecting digital transformation in higher education institutions in Kazakhstan through a multi-method research approach. The investigation integrates quantitative surveys (N=4,971 students), qualitative focus groups (N=100 faculty and administrators), and expert evaluations using PEST analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of transformation challenges. Key findings revealed that scientific and technical factors emerged as the most significant risk drivers (x? = 8.25), followed by economic constraints (x? = 7.62) and organizational readiness barriers (x?= 6.71). Survey results indicated that while 64.4% of students perceived digital technologies as beneficial for learning, 47.8% reported difficulties with digital platform usage. Focus group interviews highlighted critical challenges in three domains: infrastructure limitations (cited by 68% of faculty), pedagogical adaptation needs (noted by 72%), and ethical implications of AI integration (expressed by 85%). The PEST analysis identified technological factors as primary risk drivers, with rapid platform adoption and data security concerns ranked highest. The study advances a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating both internal and external risks in digital transformation, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions, organizational development strategies, and enhanced institutional readiness measures. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and institutional leaders implementing digital transformation initiatives in emerging educational contexts. © 2025 Fırtına Akademi A.Ş.

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, presents new challenges impacting student perceptions of academic integrity. While extensive research exists on academic misconduct and student perceptions of various infractions, there is limited understanding of how AI tools impact these views and whether their use constitutes a violation of academic integrity policies. This study explores university students’ awareness and perceptions of academic misconduct, particularly concerning AI tool usage. A survey of domestic and international students enrolled at major universities in the United States received 277 valid responses. The results reveal high awareness of university integrity policies and significant concern about the use of AI for writing papers, with substantial variance in perceptions of misconduct severity. Notably, using AI to write entire papers is seen as major misconduct by a majority, while smaller AI-assisted tasks are viewed as less severe. Regression analysis highlights the importance of ethical education, revealing that students who view AI writing as cheating and those who believe cheating is unethical perceive academic misconduct more seriously. Conversely, student demographics (major, educational level, gender, international status), awareness of AI detection tools, and perceived ethics of AI use show complex, often non-significant relationships with perceptions of misconduct severity. These findings provide indication that education and clear policy about AI usage and academic misconduct could be useful in addressing a growing number of infractions in the face of emerging AI trends. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

T2  - Journal of Academic Ethics
AB  - This qualitative study explores lecturers’ perspectives on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in personalised learning within higher education. The rapid proliferation of AI has introduced numerous ethical challenges, including the potential for academic dishonesty and misuse. One concern highlighted in this study is maintaining academic integrity while fostering responsible and ethical AI use in educational contexts. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, the research examines how lecturers navigate these complexities through innovative teaching and assessment strategies. Data were collected from 16 lecturers via open-ended questionnaires, and thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke’s six-step framework, was employed to identify recurring themes. The study is limited in its reliance on self-reported data, which may not fully capture the nuances of lecturers’ experiences or practices. Additionally, the study is context-specific, focusing on a limited sample size, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader contexts. Findings reveal that lecturers employ strategies such as using AI-detection tools like Turnitin to uphold academic integrity, redesigning assessments to include in-class components, and encouraging transparency by having students declare AI use. Another significant finding is the emphasis on fostering critical thinking skills to enable students to engage ethically with AI tools. The study recommends that higher education institutions train lecturers and students on ethical AI use, promote transparency in AI-assisted academic work, and invest in technologies that support these objectives. Revising assessment strategies to incorporate innovative, controlled formats is also suggested to mitigate misuse, ensuring the responsible integration of AI into educational practices. © The Author(s) 2025.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into higher education, particularly through Academic Performance Prediction (APP), promises enhanced educational outcomes. However, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding data privacy, potential biases, and broader socio-technical implications. Our study, focusing on Germany–a pivotal player in shaping the European Union's AI policies–seeks to understand prevailing perceptions of APP among students and the general public. Initial findings of a large standardized online survey suggest a divergence in perceptions: While students, in comparison to the general population, do not attribute a higher risk to APP in a general risk assessment, they do perceive higher societal and, in particular, individual damages from APP. Factors influencing these damage perceptions include trust in AI and personal experiences with discrimination. Students further emphasize the importance of preserving their autonomy by placing high value on self-determined data sharing and explaining their individual APP. Recognizing these varied perceptions is crucial for educators, policy-makers, and higher education institutions as they navigate the intricate ethical landscape of AI in education. This understanding can inform strategies that accommodate both the potential benefits and concerns associated with AI-driven educational tools. © 2024 The Author(s)

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Most higher education institutions employ study advisors to support their students. To adequately perform their task, study advisors have access to study information about their students. Using AI techniques to analyze that information and to predict if a student might be at risk of study delay could be a valuable tool in study advisors' practice. In this paper, we present a use case of how such a tool was developed (in the form of a dashboard) and which steps and considerations played a role in the responsible deployment of the tool. Three aspects are described: first, we present the timeline of the case study and zoom in on how the macro-level of the institution (where the groundwork is laid to facilitate AI-systems in education) and the micro-level of the implementation of the system influenced each other. Second, we describe which stakeholders were involved and what their ethical considerations were concerning data management, algorithms, and pedagogy. Third, we describe the initial evaluation of the dashboard in terms of study advisors’ experiences and provide suggestions on how to stimulate the responsible and useful implementation of a predictive modelling tool. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The growing use of generative AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) calls the sustainability of traditional assessment practices into question. Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate eloquent essays on any topic and in any language, write code in various programming languages, and ace most standardized tests, all within seconds. We conducted an international survey of educators and students in higher education to understand and compare their perspectives on the impact of generative AI across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Across three universities, 680 students and 87 educators, who moderately use generative AI, consider essay and coding assessments to be most impacted. Educators strongly prefer assessments that are adapted to assume the use of AI and encourage critical thinking, while students' reactions are mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, alongside higher-order thinking and authentic applications. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The widespread popularity of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots has sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly regarding their impact on academic integrity among students. While several studies have examined AI's role in education, a significant gap remains concerning how AI chatbot usage affects students’ perceptions of academic integrity. This study aims to address this gap through rigorous quantitative techniques to explore the dynamics of student interactions with AI chatbots and assess whether this engagement diminishes academic integrity in higher education. Using a non-experimental design, the research investigates the causal relationship between AI chatbot usage and academic integrity, focusing on eight latent variables identified in the literature. A stratified sampling technique was employed to collect a representative sample of 594 participants via a 5-point Likert scale survey from four Southern Asian countries. The dataset underwent extensive statistical analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. The findings establish significant links between motivations for using AI chatbots and a decline in academic integrity. The study identifies a behavioral link between academic integrity and pedagogical limitations, highlighting traditional classroom-based pedagogy as the most impactful factor influencing students’ motivation to engage with AI chatbots. This research not only quantitatively addresses ethical concerns related to AI in academia but also offers insights into user behavior by assigning distinct weights to post-usage behavioral factors, differentiating it from earlier studies that treated these factors equally. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The rapid adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT by students has the potential to disrupt the higher education sector, with concerns being raised by academics about potential threats to academic integrity. This paper contributes to the pressing discussion about responses to AI tools by examining students' perceptions and the use of generative AI to assist them with assessments. Based on a survey among 337 Australian university students, this study found that more than a third of students have used a chatbot for assistance with an assessment, and do not necessarily perceive this as a breach of academic integrity. The study further investigated to what extent different psychosocial factors such as learning motivations, distress or resilience are associated with students’ use of AI chatbots in order to ascertain environmental conditions or risk factors driving their use. Findings suggest that the higher education sector faces the challenge of not only defining clear policies and guidelines about ethical and academically honest ways to use and integrate generative AI tools into university education and assessments, but also to rethink the design of assessment pieces. © 2024

T2  - Humanities and Social Sciences Communications
AB  - This article addresses the ethical challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in higher education and explores the first responses of universities to these challenges globally. Drawing on five key international documents from the UN, EU, and OECD, the study used content analysis to identify key ethical dimensions related to the use of generative AI in academia, such as accountability, human oversight, transparency, or inclusiveness. Empirical evidence was compiled from 30 leading universities ranked among the top 500 in the Shanghai Ranking list from May to July 2023, covering those institutions that already had publicly available responses to these dimensions in the form of policy documents or guidelines. The paper identifies the central ethical imperative that student assignments must reflect individual knowledge acquired during their education, with human individuals retaining moral and legal responsibility for AI-related wrongdoings. This top-down requirement aligns with a bottom-up approach, allowing instructors flexibility in determining how they utilize generative AI especially large language models in their own courses. Regarding human oversight, the typical response identified by the study involves a blend of preventive measures (e.g., course assessment modifications) and soft, dialogue-based sanctioning procedures. The challenge of transparency induced the good practice of clear communication of AI use in course syllabi in the first university responses examined by this study. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on students' learning experiences and perceptions through a master’s-level course. The study specifically focused on student engagement, comfort with GenAI and ethical considerations. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an action research methodology employing qualitative data collection methods, including pre- and post-course surveys, reflective assignments, class discussions and a questionnaire. The AI-Ideas, Connections, Extensions (ICE) Framework, combining the ICE Model and AI paradigms, is used to assess students' cognitive engagement with GenAI. Findings: The study revealed that incorporating GenAI in a master’s-level instructional design course increased students' comfort with GenAI and their understanding of its ethical implications. The AI-ICE Framework demonstrated most students were at the initial engagement level, with growing awareness of GenAI’s limitations and ethical issues. Course reflections highlighted themes of improved teaching strategies, personal growth and the practical challenges of integrating GenAI responsibly. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size poses challenges to the analytical power of the findings, potentially limiting the breadth and applicability of conclusions. This constraint may affect the generalizability of the results, as the participants may not fully represent the broader population of interest. The researchers are mindful of these limitations and suggest caution in interpreting the findings, acknowledging that they may offer more exploratory insights than definitive conclusions. Future research endeavors should aim to recruit a larger cohort to validate and expand upon the initial observations, ensuring a more robust understanding. Originality/value: The study is original in its integration of GenAI into a master's-level instructional design course, assessing both the practical and ethical implications of its use in education. By utilizing the AI-ICE Framework to evaluate students' cognitive engagement and employing action research methodology, the study provides insights into how GenAI influences learning experiences and perceptions. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and the real-world application of GenAI, offering actionable strategies for its responsible use in educational settings. © 2024, Dwayne Wood and Scott H.

AB  - Despite the potential opportunities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chatbots in higher education, ethical concerns surrounding their use, such as biased data assumptions and plagiarism, have been raised. Despite studies examining these concerns in higher education, there seems to be a gap in evaluating perceptions of constructs: ethical use, attitudes towards technology, behavioral factors, and student learning outcomes relating to Generative AI Chatbots in Collegiate Aviation Programs in the U.S. Using perceptions of aviation students from six universities in the U.S. (n=271), a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of the constructs fit the empirical data well; most hypothesized relationships were significantly supported. The most substantial direct relationship was between attitude towards AI Chatbot use and behavioral intention to use AI Chatbots. Despite deep concerns about the ethical use of AI Chatbots in collegiate aviation programs, the model could explain about 59% of the variances in user behavior, suggesting relatively good user behavior among respondents. Graduate respondents had higher user behavior than first—and second-year undergraduates, who had higher scores on ethical use concerns. Male respondents showed higher user behavior than female respondents. By understanding students’ perceptions, administrators can create well-informed policy guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective integration of AI Chatbot tools in collegiate aviation programs pedagogy. © 2024, University Aviation Association.

AB  - The research aims to assess the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of the teaching and learning of journalistic writing techniques in the university educational context. The main objective consists of analysing the abilities of AI to solve the composition of different journalistic texts¸ both informative and opinion, and the quality of the result, as well as other applications of AI in journalistic writing. The text tries to contribute to the knowledge on the use of AI by teachers and students in the teaching and learning process. A mixed methodology has been used to develop the research: on the one hand, descriptive and comparative, based on surveys to university professors in Spain specialised in this subject and to students taking related contents in their studies, also in this context; on the other hand, an experimental research is included among professors trained in the field of Journalistic Writing, who are asked for the qualified correction of an exam, anonymous, actually carried out with the AI system, ChatGPT. After weighing the results, each of them is interviewed in depth about the quality of the texts, their strengths, and weaknesses. The results show that AI is beginning to be used in the university context by students and professors. In the specific field of journalistic writing, its use for the moment is limited to assisting tasks in the writing process or suggesting topics, while the automatic generation of content is not widely accepted due to the ethical implications that it entails, especially those related to the originality of content. Teachers value the potential of this technology for writing simple and informative pieces but observe limitations at deeper levels of knowledge and in hybrid texts. © 2024 Communication & Society.

T2  - IAFOR Journal of Education
AB  - In the context of education, the issues of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching and maintaining academic integrity in students’ use of AI are particularly relevant. This paper empirically examined the issue of ChatGPT usage for writing homework from the perspectives of students and professors. Study research methods included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In Study 1, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 350 Croatian students, users of ChatGPT, to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, habits, and intentions regarding ChatGPT usage for homework assignments. In Study 2, twelve faculty members were tested on their accuracy of distinguishing between original students’ papers and ChatGPT-generated papers. For this purpose, 25 different versions of papers for 8 different courses were prepared. The results of the students’ survey showed that most students still do not use ChatGPT regularly and have neutral attitudes about its usefulness, ease of use, risks, and intentions for future use. In addition, they were moderately concerned about ethical issues around its usage. Differences across gender and field of study were found. Professors, on the other hand, reported having average self-efficacy in appraising authorship, which is in line with their low average accuracy of 53%. Accuracy in distinguishing was lowest when ChatGPT was instructed to write a paper as a student. These results strongly suggest the necessity for clear guidelines, plagiarism detection tools, and educational initiatives to promote ethical use of AI technology. © 2024, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - In recent months, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had, and will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Journal of Academic Librarianship
AB  - This article addresses three key questions related to the ethical facets of algorithmic literacy. First, it synthesizes existing literature to identify six core ethical components, including bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, accuracy, and non-maleficence. Second, a crosswalk maps the intersections of these principles across the Association of College and Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and Joint Statement on Principles for Responsible Algorithmic Systems. This analysis reveals significant overlap on issues like unfairness and transparency, helping prioritize topics for instruction. Finally, case studies showcase pedagogical strategies for teaching ethical considerations, informed by the crosswalk. Workshops for diverse undergraduates and computer science students employed reallife instances of algorithmic bias to prompt reflection on unintended harm, contestability, and responsible development. Pre-post surveys indicated expanded critical perspectives after the interventions. By systematically examining shared values and testing instructional approaches, this study provides practical tools to shape ethical thinking on algorithms. It also demonstrates promising practices for responsibly advancing algorithmic literacy across disciplines. Ultimately, fostering interdisciplinary awareness and multipronged educational initiatives can empower students to question algorithmic authority and biases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Geriatric comanagement has been shown to improve outcomes of older surgical inpatients. Furthermore, the choice of discharge location, that is, continuity of care, can have a fundamental impact on convalescence. These challenges and demands have led to the SURGE-Ahead project that aims to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for geriatric comanagement in surgical clinics including a decision support for the best continuity of care option, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Objective: This qualitative study aims to explore the current challenges and demands in surgical geriatric patient care. Based on these challenges, the study explores the attitude of interviewees toward the introduction of an AI-supported CDSS (AI-CDSS) in geriatric patient care in surgery, focusing on technical and general wishes about an AI-CDSS, as well as ethical considerations. Methods: In this study, 15 personal interviews with physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and social workers, employed in surgical departments at a university hospital in Southern Germany, were conducted in April 2022. Interviews were conducted in person, transcribed, and coded by 2 researchers (AU, LB) using content and thematic analysis. During the analysis, quotes were sorted into the main categories of geriatric patient care, use of an AI-CDSS, and ethical considerations by 2 authors (AU, LB). The main themes of the interviews were subsequently described in a narrative synthesis, citing key quotes. Results: In total, 399 quotes were extracted and categorized from the interviews. Most quotes could be assigned to the primary code challenges in geriatric patient care (111 quotes), with the most frequent subcode being medical challenges (45 quotes). More quotes were assigned to the primary code chances of an AI-CDSS (37 quotes), with its most frequent subcode being holistic patient overview (16 quotes), then to the primary code limits of an AI-CDSS (26 quotes). Regarding the primary code technical wishes (37 quotes), most quotes could be assigned to the subcode intuitive usability (15 quotes), followed by mobile availability and easy access (11 quotes). Regarding the main category ethical aspects of an AI-CDSS, most quotes could be assigned to the subcode critical position toward trust in an AI-CDSS (9 quotes), followed by the subcodes respecting the patient’s will and individual situation (8 quotes) and responsibility remaining in the hands of humans (7 quotes). Conclusions: Support regarding medical geriatric challenges and responsible handling of AI-based recommendations, as well as necessity for a holistic approach focused on usability, were the most important topics of health care professionals in surgery regarding development of an AI-CDSS for geriatric care. These findings, together with the wish to preserve the patient-caregiver relationship, will help set the focus for the ongoing development of AI-supported CDSS. © Adriane Uihlein, Lisa Beissel, Anna Hanane Ajlani, Marcin Orzechowski, Christoph Leinert, Thomas Derya Kocar, Carlos Pankratz, Konrad Schuetze, Florian Gebhard, Florian Steger, Marina Liselotte Fotteler, Michael Denkinger.

TI  - Ethical concerns for using artificial intelligence chatbots in research and publication: Evidences from Saudi Arabia
AU  - Sobaih, A.E.E.
T2  - Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational generative chatbots have drawn the attention of academics and have been increasingly used in the scientific research process since the inauguration of ChatGPT in November 2022. Despite growing research on AI chatbots’ usage in research and publication, limited studies have deeply addressed the ethical concerns that arise from their usage. This research explores the perceptions of academics and their leaders regarding the use of AI chatbots in research and publication. It addresses the ethical dilemma and ethical approaches considered by academics and their leaders for shaping their decisions for the use or non-use of chatbots in scientific research. For these purposes, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 academics/researchers and 11 leaders of scientific research in public universities in Saudi Arabia. The results of the thematic analysis confirmed that AI chatbots are extensively used in scientific research, albeit many researchers present their publications as their own work with no acknowledgement of the support from chatbots. The results showed ten interrelated ethical concerns, which would impact the growth of pseudoscience in developing countries if these concerns were not overcome. Hence, strategies for mitigating these ethical concerns are suggested. The research showed that academics often use chatbots based on a “utilitarian” approach, whereas most leaders consider the “virtue” or the “common good” approach for their concerns about chatbot adoption in scientific research. This research calls for policy and interventions from policymakers and other stakeholders about the responsible and ethical use of chatbots in research and publication. © 2024. Abu Elnasr E. Sobaih.

T2  - International Journal of Information and Learning Technology
AB  - Purpose: This study examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, on higher education (HE). The ease with which content can be generated using GenAI has raised concerns across academia regarding its role in academic contexts, particularly regarding summative assessments. This research makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining university student and staff perceptions of current and future issues pertaining to the role of GenAI in universities. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method involving five one-to-one semi-structured interviews with four students and a lecturer explored the ethical and practical issues of GenAI text generation in academia. An inductive thematic analysis was chosen as it provided nuanced insights aligned with the study’s goals. Findings: Use of GenAI was discussed within the context of a range of topics, including perceptions of academic misconduct, authorial integrity and issues pertaining to university policies. Participants universally defined traditional classifications of academic misconduct but were unable to provide clear definitions where the use of GenAI was included for writing summative assessments. Students showed a more open engagement with GenAI, considering it a tool for overcoming obstacles rather than a means to plagiarise. Educators were generally more cautious and less optimistic about the academic role of GenAI. Lack of clear institutional policies surrounding such tools also contributed to ethical ambiguities. Originality/value: The study highlights diverging perspectives between students and academics, which necessitate a forum for dialogue, ensuring the need to develop clear policies to steer the integration of GenAI in a manner that is beneficial for students and academics. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - The ethics of artificial intelligence use in university libraries in Zimbabwe
AU  - Tsekea, S.
AU  - Mandoga, E.
T2  - Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics
AB  - Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised higher education teaching and learning. AI has the power to analyse large amounts of data and make intelligent predictions thus changing the whole teaching and learning processes. However, such a rise has led to institutions questioning the morality of these applications. The changes have left librarians and educators worried about the major ethical questions surrounding privacy, equality of information, protection of intellectual property, cheating, misinformation and job security. Libraries have always been concerned about ethics and many go out of their way to make sure communities are educated about the ethical question. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has caught them unaware. Methods: This research investigates the preparedness of higher education librarians to support the ethical use of information within the higher and tertiary education fraternity. A qualitative approach was used for this study. Interviews were done with thirty purposively selected librarians and academics from universities in Zimbabwe. Results: Findings indicated that many university libraries in Zimbabwe are still at the adoption stage of artificial intelligence. It was also found that institutions and libraries are not yet prepared for AI use and are still crafting policies on the use of AI. Discussion: Libraries seem prepared to adopt AI. They are also prepared to offer training on how to protect intellectual property but have serious challenges in issues of transparency, data security, plagiarism detection and concerns about job losses. However, with no major ethical policies having been crafted on AI use, it becomes challenging for libraries to full adopt its usage. Copyright © 2025 Tsekea and Mandoga.

AB  - The high performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) in examination contexts has triggered an intense debate about their applications, effects and risks. What legal aspects need to be considered when using LLM in teaching and assessment? What possibilities do language models offer? Statutes and laws are used to assess the use of LLM: – University statutes, state higher education laws, licensing regulations for doctors – Copyright Act (UrhG) – General Data Protection Regulation (DGPR) – AI Regulation (EU AI Act) LLM and AI offer opportunities but require clear university frameworks. These should define legitimate uses and areas where use is prohibited. Cheating and plagiarism violate good scientific practice and copyright laws. Cheating is difficult to detect. Plagiarism by AI is possible. Users of the products are responsible. LLM are effective tools for generating exam questions. Nevertheless, careful review is necessary as even apparently high-quality products may contain errors. However, the risk of copyright infringement with AI-generated exam questions is low, as copyright law allows up to 15% of protected works to be used for teaching and exams. The grading of exam content is subject to higher education laws and regulations and the GDPR. Exclusively computer-based assessment without human review is not permitted. For high-risk applications in education, the EU's AI Regulation will apply in the future. When dealing with LLM in assessments, evaluation criteria for existing assessments can be adapted, as can assessment programmes, e.g. to reduce the motivation to cheat. LLM can also become the subject of the examination themselves. Teachers should undergo further training in AI and consider LLM as an addition. © 2024 März et al.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education. While universities have generally touted technological advancements as part of the fabric of their learning environments, the challenges to equitable outcomes for faculty and students related to the use of AI are under-recognized. There is scant work on the equity and morality of university AI policies and the implications for faculty within higher education institutions. While significant attention has been paid to the effect of tools like ChatGPT on student writing and academic integrity, less attention has been paid to how rapidly emerging AI policies affect other aspects of faculty work, and in potentially inequitable ways. This article considers AI policies at three large state universities to examine what policies are provided to faculty and their impacts, including instructional support for students, faculty research, and patents. Findings suggest that institutions vary greatly in terms of faculty guidance and far more work is needed to provide clear policies and resources regarding ethical AI for faculty. We discuss the implications, including challenges and opportunities for higher education institutions, and provide recommendations for moving forward as new technology continues to evolve. © 2024 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - More than a year has passed since reports of ChatGPT-3.5’s capability to pass exams sent shockwaves through education circles. These initial concerns led to a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary study to assess the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) against assessment tasks used across 10 engineering subjects, showcasing the capability of GenAI. Assessment types included online quiz, numerical, oral, visual, programming and writing (experimentation, project, reflection and critical thinking, and research). Twelve months later, the study was repeated using new and updated tools ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini, SciSpace and Wolfram. The updated study investigated the performance and capability differences, identifying the best tool for each assessment type. The findings show that increased performance and features can only heighten academic integrity concerns. While cheating concerns are central, opportunities to integrate GenAI to enhance teaching and learning are possible. While each GenAI tool had specific strengths and weaknesses, ChatGPT-4 was well-rounded. A GenAI Assessment Security and Opportunity Matrix is presented to provide the community practical guidance on managing assessment integrity risks and integration opportunities to enhance learning. © 2024 The Author(s).

T2  - International Journal of the Legal Profession
AB  - Assessing law students has always been a challenging task, but the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, compounds the problems already caused by increased student numbers, contract cheating and budget cuts in universities. As GenAI rapidly develops, legal educators must find ways to accommodate, and even incorporate, GenAI into their curricula and assessments so that law graduates can understand its capabilities and limitations within legal practice. Simultaneously, many jurisdictions, including Australia, have legislative obligations to deliver law graduates who satisfy legal knowledge-based “eligibility” requirements for admission into practice. This article introduces a knowledge framework for managing GenAI in legal education consisting of three pillars: Substantive Legal Knowledge, GenAI Ethics Knowledge, and GenAI System Knowledge. The authors argue this framework can assist legal educators in designing optimal assessments in an AI-disrupted world. The article employs the knowledge framework to examine the experiences and views of Australian law students’ engagement with GenAI outputs in completing a compulsory legal ethics assessment in 2023. This empirical case study demonstrates that effective assessment design incorporating GenAI can enhance law student and graduate outcomes despite the ongoing challenges for legal educators and the profession associated with GenAI. © 2024 The Author(s).

T2  - New Directions for Teaching and Learning
AB  - While AI has the potential to streamline assessment development in higher education, there are concerns about its reliability, fairness, and potential to perpetuate bias. This study sought to understand the perceptions of academics and teaching and learning (T&L) specialists on the use of AI tools and large language models on assessment development, whether the private HE institution (PHEI) needs to change how it assesses students, and the types of assessments to be created. This topic is extremely relevant, as many higher education institutions (HEIs) are entering unchartered territory, and there is scant credible evidence on the prior-implementation reporting and evaluation of AI integration into assessment practices. Forty academics and T&L specialists at a PHEI in South Africa shared their perceptions. The study revealed two key themes: (a) AI use and (b) reconceptualizing assessments and T&L structures, indicating the need for HEIs to understand the synergies between AI and assessment practices. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This mixed-methods study aims to examine factors influencing academicians’ intentions to continue using AI-based chatbots by integrating the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model and social network characteristics. Background AI-powered chatbots are gaining popularity across industries, including academia. However, empirical research on academicians’ adoption behavior is limited. This study proposes an integrated model incorporating TTF factors and social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness to understand academics’ continuance intentions. Methodology A qualitative study involving 31 interviews of academics from India examined attitudes and the potential role of social network characteristics like density, homophily, and connectedness in adoption. Results showed positive sentiment towards chatbots and themes on how peer groups accelerate diffusion. In the second phase, a survey of 448 faculty members from prominent Indian universities was conducted to test the proposed research model. Contribution The study proposes and validates an integrated model of TTF and social network factors that influence academics’ continued usage intentions toward AI chatbots. It highlights the nuanced role of peer networks in shaping adoption. Findings Task and technology characteristics positively affected academics’ intentions to continue AI chatbot usage. Among network factors, density showed the strongest effect on TTF and perceived usefulness, while homophily and connectedness had partial effects. The study provides insights into designing appropriate AI tools for the academic context. Recommendations AI chatbot designers should focus on aligning features to academics’ task for Practitioners needs and preferences. Compatibility with academic work culture is critical. Given peer network influences, training and demonstrations to user groups can enhance adoption. Platforms should have capabilities for collaborative use. Targeted messaging customized to disciplines can resonate better with academic subgroups. Multidisciplinary influencers should be engaged. Concerns like plagiarism risks, privacy, and job impacts should be transparently addressed. Recommendations More studies are needed across academic subfields to understand nuanced for Researchers requirements and barriers. Further studies are recommended to investigate differences across disciplines and demographics, relative effects of specific network factors like size, proximity, and frequency of interaction, the role of academic leadership and institutional policies in enabling chatbot adoption, and how AI training biases impact usefulness perceptions and ethical issues. Impact on Society Increased productivity in academia through the appropriate and ethical use of AI can enhance quality, access, and equity in education. AI can assist in mundane tasks, freeing academics’ time for higher-order objectives like critical thinking development. Responsible AI design and policies considering socio-cultural aspects will benefit sustainable growth. With careful implementation, it can make positive impacts on student engagement, learning support, and research efficiency. Future Research Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impacts of AI chatbot usage in academia. Track usage behaviors over time as familiarity develops. Investigate differences across academic disciplines and roles. Requirements may vary for humanities versus STEM faculty or undergraduate versus graduate students. Assess user trust in AI and how it evolves with repeated usage, and examine trust-building strategies. Develop frameworks to assess pedagogical effectiveness and ethical risks of conversational agents in academic contexts.

T2  - Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching and Learning
AB  - Purpose: ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot, has gained substantial attention in the academic world for its potential to transform the education industry. While ChatGPT offers numerous benefits, concerns have also been raised regarding its impact on the quality of education. This study aims to bridge the gap in research by exploring teachers' perspectives on the adoption of ChatGPT, with a focus on identifying factors that motivate and inhibit them to adopt ChatGPT for educational purposes. Design/methodology/approach: This research has employed a interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) qualitative approach. Through in-depth interviews among the teachers, data will be collected to identify the motivating and inhibiting factors that impact teachers' willingness to adopt ChatGPT. The data was collected from 34 teachers working across 10 branches of the University of Technology and Applied Sciences (UTAS) in Oman. Findings: The analysis revealed four themes under motivating factors that encourage teachers to adopt ChatGPT for their educational purpose. These include Theme 1: Exploration of innovative education technologies, Theme 2: Personalization teaching and learning, Theme 3: Time-saving and Theme 4: Professional development. On the other hand, inhibiting factors includes five themes which includes Theme 1: Reliability and accuracy concerns, Theme 2: Reduced human interaction, Theme 3: Privacy and data security, Theme 4: lack of institutional support and Theme 5: Overreliance on ChatGPT. Practical implications: This study contributes to the understanding of teachers' perspectives on the adoption of ChatGPT in education. By understanding teachers' perspectives, policymakers can design appropriate policies and service providers can customize their offerings to meet teachers' requirements. The study's findings will be valuable for higher education institutions (HEIs) in formulating policies to ensure the appropriate and effective utilization of ChatGPT. The study will provide suggestions to ChatGPT service providers, enabling them to focus on motivating factors and address inhibiting factors, thereby facilitating the seamless adoption of ChatGPT among teachers. Originality/value: In comparison to previous studies, this study goes beyond merely discussing the possible benefits and limitations of ChatGPT in education. This research significantly contributes to the understanding of ChatGPT adoption among teachers by identifying specific motivating and inhibiting factors that influence teachers to adopt ChatGPT for educational purposes. The research enables to gain important new insights that were not previously found, giving a fresh dimension to the existing literature. © 2023, Habiba Al-Mughairi and Preeti Bhaskar.

AB  - This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on loss in decision-making, laziness, and privacy concerns among university students in Pakistan and China. Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Academic integrity surrounding the use of generative AI in higher education: Lenses from ICT college students
AU  - Plecerda, L.P.
T2  - Environment and Social Psychology
AB  - The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) in education marks a transformative shift in teaching, learning, and assessment practices. GenAI technologies have evolved from being simple conversational agents to highly advanced systems capable of generating human-like text, solving complex problems, assisting in creative writing, tutoring, and even providing personalized feedback to students. This paper explored the use of GenAI in education with emphasis on its implications towards academic integrity. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) college students (n=30) were purposively sampled to be interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions about the use of GenAI in their program. Thematic analysis was carried out to identify emerging themes and assess the implications of GenAI use in education, particularly ICT learning processes. Students believed that GenAI offers significant benefits, such as personalized learning, assistance in creative writing, tutoring, coding, and grading, which enhance students’ learning experiences by providing instant feedback and helping them understand difficult concepts. Concerns about over-reliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty have emerged, as some students use AI tools to bypass intellectual effort, raising questions about the authenticity of their work. ICT students expressed concerns about GenAI fostering cheating and undermining academic independence. Despite these issues, students remain optimistic about GenAI’s role in education, advocating for clear guidelines on its appropriate use to balance its benefits with the need for academic integrity. The integration of GenAI in educational settings necessitates careful management to ensure that it supports, rather than diminishes, the learning process. © 2024 by author(s).

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Implications for Academic Cheating: Expanding the Dimensions of Responsible Human-AI Collaboration with ChatGPT and Bard
AU  - Oravec, J.A.
T2  - Journal of Interactive Learning Research
AB  - Cheating is a growing academic and ethical concern in higher education. The technological “arms race” that involves cheating-detection system developers versus technology-savvy students is attracting increased attention to cheating issues; it is also generating iterations of technological innovations as corporations, higher educational institutions, and legal experts attempt to control the situation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has added new dimensions to academic cheating challenges as students (as well as faculty and staff) can easily access powerful systems for generating content that can be presented in assignments, exams, or published papers as their own. AI methodology is also providing some emerging anti-cheating approaches, including facial recognition and watermarking. This paper provides an overview of human/AI collaboration approaches and frames some educational misuses of ChatGPT as forms of “misattributed co-authorship.” As with other kinds of collaborations, the work that students produce with AI assistance can be presented in transparent and straightforward modes or (unfortunately) in opaquer and ethically-problematic ways. However, rather than just for catching or entrapping students, the emerging varieties of technological cheating-detection strategies can be used to assist students in learning how to document and attribute properly their AI-empowered as well as human-human collaborations. Construing misuses of ChatGPT as misattributed co-authorship can recognize the growing capabilities of AI systems and how stressing responsible and mindful usage by students can help prepare them for a highly collaborative, AI-saturated future. © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

TI  - ‘Words are Flowing Out Like Endless Rain Into a Paper Cup’: ChatGPT & Law School Assessments
AU  - Hargreaves, S.
T2  - Legal Education Review
AB  - ChatGPT is a sophisticated large-language model able to answer high-level questions in a way that is does not trigger conventional plagiarism detectors. Concerns have been raised that and similar forms of ‘generative AI’ pose a significant threat to academic integrity in higher education. To evaluate this risk in the context of legal education specifically, this project had ChatGPT (using the GPT3.5 model available in January 2023) generate answers to twenty-four different exams from an English-language law school based in a common law jurisdiction. It found that the system performed best on exams that were essay-based and asked students to discuss international legal instruments or general legal principles not necessarily specific to any jurisdiction. It performed worst on exams that featured problem-style or “issue spotting” questions asking students to apply an invented factual scenario to local legislation or jurisprudence. While the project suggests that for the most part conventional law school assessments are for the time being relatively immune from the threat generative AI brings, the project provides only a baseline snapshot of how large-language models tackle assessment in higher education. As both the technology improves and students learn how to harness it, increasingly fewer forms of assessment will be beyond its reach. However, rather than attempt to block students from using AI as part of learning and assessment, this paper instead proposes three ways students may be taught to use it in appropriate and ethical ways. While it is clear that generative AI will change how universities teach and assess (across disciplines), a solution of prevention or denial is no solution at all. © 2023, Australasian Law Academics Association.

TI  - ChatGPT and its impact on competence training in occupational therapists: a reflection on academic integrity
AU  - Avello-Sáez, D.
AU  - Estrada-Palavecino, L.
T2  - Brazilian Journal of Occupational Therapy
AB  - Public access to artificial intelligence, and specifically to ChatGPT, is presenting challenges in the professional training of occupational therapists. In this context, this essay aims to describe the impact of artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on ChatGPT, on the training of occupational therapists and proposes strategies to integrate these technologies into higher education from an integrative, ethical perspective, in line with the values and principles of academic integrity. While this tool can be used to provide theoretical knowledge and enhance content learning, it also poses a risk for dishonest behaviors in the academic realm. Therefore, it is essential that educators understand its use and promote experiential methodologies that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and reflection. The challenge lies in the implementation of policies and strategies that promote the development of professional skills and the ethical and effective use of these technologies in training future occupational therapists, such as declaring its use in written works, modeling by teachers, and integration into training methodologies. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

T2  - Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence
AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate attitudes of both students and teachers concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the L2 classroom. The study was a descriptive, qualitative, mixedmethods case study whose data were taken from a purposive, convenient sample at a private, English-speaking university during the Summer Semester 2023 in Beirut, Lebanon. Data collection primarily involved an online survey on Google forms which was given to a sample of 49 students taking a research-based English 202 course of which 46 were completed. Afterwards, six English teachers and six students were chosen based on their voluntary will to participate in individual interviews for the former and semi-structured focus group interviews for the latter. The findings revealed that approximately 85% of students did indeed use AI unethically to get ideas for their assignments, assist them in their projects' “blue-prints” or do their assignments/projects altogether. The findings also revealed that a “love/hate” relationship seemed to dictate students' relationships with AI, where students did indeed make use of AI but were distrusting of it for privacy and equity concerns. Finally, findings also revealed that most of the interviewed instructors' readiness to undergo training for AI was more to monitor students' potential misuse of it. The article purposes a suggestive revamping of course learning objectives due to students' inclinations to misuse AI to do their coursework with 89.4% of students willing to use AI to complete their coursework should university punitive measures be removed; furthermore, the article equally proposes future research investigating the impact and use of AI in the higher educational classroom on student performance and that it be used with a “grain of salt” as it may unleash a Pandora's box of future generations graduating without the necessary know-how in delicate professions of medicine, nursing, engineering, architecture among others. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This article investigates the perspectives of Romanian academics on implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE). The article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies’ leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of academics, to gains in the learning–teaching process, improvements in students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves, and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results of this research is mainly empirical and practical. These opinions should be used as resources for managers of HE institutions to develop better policies concerning the implementation of AI in HE and for strategic vision toward AI, with the ultimate purpose of achieving progress and prosperity for the entire society. © 2023 by the authors.

We utilise an experimental philosophy approach to i) determine university teachers’ intuitions around universities’ responsibilities to adopt new artificial intelligence technologies, ii) understand the conditions under which university teachers consider artificial intelligence defensible and, hence, would be willing to introduce such tools and services into their daily practice and iii) specify teachers’ self-reported knowledge of artificial intelligence. An online survey, where participants were sent one of three different cases (Case A related to first-generation students, Case B, an archetypical student, Case C, students with a learning disability), and 18 identical questions across all three cases. The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - In August 2020, students took to the streets of London in a mass protest over their A-level results (that determine entry to university), chanting 'F∗ck the algorithm.' Their A-level grades had been determined by an algorithm that depended on past school performance, a system of teacher ratings, and for smaller student groups, the use of Centre Assessed Grades. Commendably Ofqual (the U.K. Government Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) were transparent in their use of the algorithm so that affected stakeholders were informed of the algorithm's existence and the key details of how it was developed. The design of the data set produced an algorithm with biased outputs, which hardcoded preexisting educational, policy, and societal biases. Due to the large numbers of students, the single 'results day' output and the wider interests of schools, teachers, parents, and universities, the unfairness of the outcome was magnified. Add to this that the students were, by definition, academically proficient individuals, many of whom derived from privileged and supportive backgrounds, which meant that they had the awareness and capacity to challenge. Hence, the impact of this biased algorithm was not received silently and so it was hard to deny, deflect, and dismiss. However, this is not always the case, and many systems are deployed with similar biases and harmful outcomes but the impact is dissipated over time and individuals, and therefore not so immediately obvious and easy to challenge. This is particularly the case when the people impacted do not have the advantages that enabled the A-level students to challenge. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Who Will Watch the Watchmen? The Ethico-political Arrangements of Algorithmic Proctoring for Academic Integrity
AU  - Henry, J.V.
AU  - Oliver, M.
T2  - Postdigital Science and Education
AB  - Critics of artificial intelligence have suggested that the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency (FATE) have been used for ‘ethics washing’, in order to appease industrial interests. In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) first made its entry into higher education in the form of paraphrasing tools. These tools were used to take passages that were copied from sources, and through various methods, disguised the original text to avoid academic integrity violations. At first, these tools were not very good and produced nearly incomprehensible output. However, through the use of generative artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the current engines supporting these tools have become better and more efficient at producing quality output. Recently, the artificial intelligence research company, OpenAI, developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence engine to drive a conversational chat frontend application called ChatGPT. Backed by an expansive knowledge base that could rival any university library in volume, this AI-driven conversational application can produce well-written, seemingly academic, responses to questions.

We selected six mathematical statements to conduct interviews with three students. We present the emergent framework, Students' Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students' use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students' use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.

AB  - This paper shares the reflections of a small group of graduate students and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the challenges and affordances of using large language model (LLM) tools to assist with academic writing in an English Medium Education (EME) context. The influence of interpretive grounded theory afforded the authors the opportunity to engage with emerging data from a focus group interview. Ethical issues including academic integrity and maturity formed a major theme of this study, as well as the future-thinking affordances of LLMs in facilitating and democratizing academic writing for all, including those in EME programs. Considering that LLMs are here to stay and will be used by students and faculty alike, the authors consider that the nature of assessment is likely to change and indeed will require higher education institutions to consider the types of assessments in place, with a view to potentially modifying them in light of these technological advance

This paper aims to assess to what extent genAi can be used to obtain guidance on how to avoid detection when commissioning and submitting contract-written assignments and how workable the offered solutions are. Design/methodology/approach: Although ChatGPT is programmed not to provide answers that are unethical or that may cause harm to people, ChatGPT's can be prompted to answer with inverted moral valence, thereby supplying unethical answers. The authors tasked ChatGPT to generate 30 essays that discussed the benefits of submitting contract-written undergraduate assignments and outline the best ways of avoiding detection. The authors scored the likelihood that ChatGPT's suggestions would be successful in avoiding detection by markers when submitting contract-written work.

AB  - This paper presents the case of an adjunct university professor to illustrate the dilemma of using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to grade student papers. The hypothetical case discusses the benefits of using a commercial AI service to grade student papers–including discretion, convenience, pedagogical merits of consistent feedback for students, and advances made in the field that yield high-quality work–all of which are achieved quickly. Arguments against using AI to grade student papers involve cost, privacy, legality, and ethics. The paper discusses career implications for faculty members in both situations and concludes with implications for researchers within the discourse on academic integrity.

After the entry of ChatGPT–a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses a deep learning model to generate human-like text response based on provided input–it has become crucial for HEIs to be exposed to the implications of AI-based tools on students' learning outcomes, commonly measured using an assessment-based approach to improve program quality, teaching effectiveness, and other learning support. An empirical study has been conducted to test the ChatGPT capability of solving a variety of assignments (from different level courses of undergraduate degree programs) to compare its performance with the highest scored student(s).

There although has been increasing concern about how to systematically enhance the AI applications effect, AI risk governance in HCAI education has not been discussed yet. This study adopted literature meta-analysis, along with the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods in order to establish the risk framework and calculate the index weight of HCAI education. The results confirm that the risk framework includes eight indicators, which respectively are misunderstanding of the HCAI concept (MC), misuse of AI resources (MR), mismatching of AI pedagogy (MP), privacy security risk (PSR), transparency risk (TR), accountability risk (AR), bias risk (BR), and perceived risk (PR). Meanwhile, the eight indicators are divided into four categories such as HCAI concept, application process, ethical security, and man-machine interaction. Moreover, the trend of ris

In this article, I look at the practicalities of AI in education and at the attendant ethical issues it raises. My key conclusion is that AI in the near- to medium-term future has the potential to enrich student learning and complement the work of (human) teachers without dispensing with them. In addition, AI should increasingly enable such traditional divides as 'school versus home' to be straddled with regard to learning. AI offers the hope of increasing personalization in education, but it is accompanied by risks of learning becoming less social. There is much that we can learn from previous introductions of new technologies in school to help maximize the likelihood tha

Within the ambit of the online (hybrid) teaching and learning approach that became dominant during the COVID-19 pandemic, the NWU established a Community of Practice for Academic Integrity (CoPAI) to enhance Academic Integrity (AI) in a holistic manner. By critically discussing the NWU's response through their CoPAI, the lessons learned, and strategies developed in the process, the NWU can hopefully assist other Higher Education institutes to progressively enhance AI in the future. This is important, because many contextual shifts in teaching and learning approaches, pedagogy, assessment, and the application of technology, that were enforced in an online mode of delivery during the pandemic, will prevail in future.

Modern technology that is easy to access and free to use, like ChatGPT, is changing the educational landscape as it is an example of a large language model – an artificial intelligence network – that can process and generate text that reads as though it were written by a person. Using a survey and semi-structured interviews, this exploratory mixed-method study examined social work educators' experiences of addressing students' use of ChatGPT and found that although they are uncomfortable with addressing ChatGPT use with their students, they believe it is necessary to communicate its ethical use to them. Results also suggested that while using ChatGPT as a learning tool is valid, it can be overused. ChatGPT use gives students a fals

The study was conducted over 3 years at a large Australian university, and findings demonstrate that familiarity with the system over time improved student attitudes towards remote invigilation. Positive experiences were found to be related to ease of use and convenience for test sitting. The majority of students reported that it was important for the institution to have approaches such as remote invigilation to discourage cheating and they believed that the system was useful in this regard. Perceived technical problems were found to invoke feelings of anxiety with being remotely invigilated, and students suggested that greater clarity on expectations of appropriate behaviour, privacy and data security would help alleviate discomfort and improve the system.
